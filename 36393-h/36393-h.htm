<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span>THE BEST POLICY</h1>
<h2><a name='c1' id='c1'></a>AN INCIDENTAL COMEDY</h2>
<p>
Naturally, when Harry Beckford married he began
to take a more serious view of life. If there is
anything at all of thoughtfulness and consideration
in a man, marriage brings it out: he begins to plan.
He has some one dependent upon him, some one for
whom he must provide. That he should trust to luck
before was solely his affair; that he should trust to
luck now is quite another matter.
</p>
<p>
In the case of Beckford, as in the cases of most
other young men, this feeling was of gradual growth.
He was optimistic and happy; his future looked long
and bright; he had ample time in which to accumulate
a comfortable fortune; but—he wasn’t even beginning.
He and his wife so enjoyed life that they were
spending all he made. It wasn’t a large sum, but it
was enough to make them comfortable and contented,
enough to give them all reasonable pleasures. Later—he
thought of this only in a hazy, general sort of
way—they would begin to save. There was plenty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
time for this, for they were both young, and he had
proved himself of sufficient value to his employer to
make his rapid advancement practically certain. The
employer was a big corporation, the general manager
of which had taken a deep personal interest in him,
and the opportunities were limitless.
</p>
<p>
But the feeling of responsibility that came to him
with marriage gradually took practical form, perhaps
because the girl who sat opposite him at the breakfast-table
was so very impractical. She was loving, lovable,
delightfully whimsical, but also unreasoningly impractical
in many ways. Before marriage she never
had known a care; after marriage her cares were much
like those of a child with a doll-house—they gave zest
to life but could be easily put aside. If the maid
proved recalcitrant, it was annoying, but they could
dine at a restaurant and go to the theater afterward,
and Harry would help her with breakfast the next
morning. Harry was so awkward, but so willing, that
it all became a huge joke. Harry had not passed the
stage where he would “kiss the cook” in these circumstances,
and an occasional hour in the kitchen is not so
bad when there is a fine handsome young man there,
to be ordered about and told to “behave himself.” So
even marriage had not yet awakened Isabel Beckford
to the stern realities of life.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
It was her impracticalness, her delightful dependence,
that finally brought Harry to the point of serious
thought. What would she do, if anything happened
to him? Her father had been successful but
improvident: he would leave hardly enough for her
mother alone to live in modest comfort; and, besides,
Harry was not the kind of youth to put his responsibilities
on another. He began to think seriously about
cutting expenses and putting something aside, even
at this early day. The really successful men had begun
at the beginning to do this. Then there came to
his notice the sad case of Mrs. Baird, who was left
with nothing but a baby. Baird had been a young
man of excellent promise and a good income, but he
had left his widow destitute. He had put nothing
aside, intending, doubtless, to begin that later.
</p>
<p>
“Just like me,” thought Harry, as he looked at his
girl-wife across the table.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t it frightful?” she asked, referring to the
little tragedy contained in the item he had just read
to her from the morning paper. “Every one thought
the Bairds were so prosperous, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Every one thinks we are prosperous,” he commented
thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s different!” she exclaimed. “You
mustn’t talk like that or you’ll make me gloomy for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
the whole day! Why, it sounds as if you were expecting
to die!”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all,” he replied, “but neither was Baird.”
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t!” she pleaded. “I shan’t have another
happy minute—until I’ve forgotten what you
said.”
</p>
<p>
He laughed at the ingenuousness of this and blew
her a kiss across the table; but he did not abandon the
subject.
</p>
<p>
“Baird was a young man,” he persisted, “but, with
a little care and forethought, he could have left things
in fair shape.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps we ought to be saving a little,” she admitted
in a tone of whimsical protest. “I’ll help you
do it, if you just won’t make me blue.”
</p>
<p>
“He hadn’t even life insurance,” he remarked, “and
neither have I.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, not insurance!” she cried. “I wouldn’t like
that at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, think how much you could do with
the money you’d be paying to the old life insurance
company!”
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t it be just the same if you were saving
it?” he argued.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; not at all,” she asserted. “Why, you can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
get money that you’re saving whenever you want it,
but life insurance money is clear out of your reach.”
</p>
<p>
“A policy has a cash surrender value,” he explained.
“Every cent paid in premiums adds to its
value, if you want to give it up.”
</p>
<p>
“But then you lose the insurance,” she argued with
feminine inconsistency.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” he admitted, “just as you lose your
savings when you spend them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, but you can get at your savings easier, and
it’s easier to start again, if you happen to use them,”
she insisted.
</p>
<p>
“The very reason why life insurance is better for
us,” he said. “I want to make sure of something for
you that we’re certain not to touch while I live.”
</p>
<p>
But she took the unreasonable view of insurance
that some young women do take, and refused to be
convinced.
</p>
<p>
“If I should die first,” she said, with a little shudder
at the very thought of death for either of them,
“all the money you’d paid the company would be
wasted.”
</p>
<p>
“Not necessarily,” he returned. “There might
be—”
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” she interrupted, blushing so prettily that
he went over and kissed her. Then he dropped the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
subject temporarily, which was the wisest thing he
could have done. She had the feminine objection to
paying out money for which she got no immediate return,
but she wanted to please her husband. She was
capricious, imperious at times and then meekly submissive—a
spoiled child who surrendered to the emotion
of the moment, but whose very inconsistencies
were captivating. So when she decided that victory
was hers, she also decided to be generous: to please
him she would make a concession.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve changed my mind about insurance,” she told
him a few days later. As a matter of fact, she had
changed her mind, but not her opinions: she was not
convinced, but she would please him by accepting his
plan—with a slight modification.
</p>
<p>
“I knew you would see the wisdom of it!” he exclaimed
joyously.
</p>
<p>
“How much insurance did you plan to get?” she
asked, with a pretty assumption of business ways.
</p>
<p>
“Ten thousand dollars,” he replied.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll divide it,” she said, “and each get five
thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean that you’ll be insured, too?” he asked
doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Of course. Isn’t my life worth as much as
yours?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
“More! a thousand times more!” he cried, “but—but—”
</p>
<p>
Her eyes showed her indignation, and he stopped
short.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t want me to be insured!” she exclaimed
hotly. “You don’t think I’m worth it!”
</p>
<p>
“Why, dearest,” he protested, “you’re worth all the
insurance of all the people in the world, but it isn’t
necessary in your case. It’s my earning capacity
that—”
</p>
<p>
Unfortunate suggestion! There was an inference
that she considered uncomplimentary.
</p>
<p>
“Haven’t I any earning capacity?” she demanded.
“Don’t I earn every cent I get? Isn’t the home as important
as the office?”
</p>
<p>
“Surely, surely, darling, but—”
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t a good wife earn half of the income that
she shares?” she persisted.
</p>
<p>
“More than half, sweetheart.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say ‘sweetheart’ to me in the same breath
that you tell me I’m not worth being insured!” she
cried. “It’s positively insulting, and—and—you always
said you loved me.”
</p>
<p>
Her voice broke a little, and he was beside her in
an instant.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t understand,” he explained. “Insurance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
has nothing to do with your value to me or my value
to you, but there is a more worldly value—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’re of some account in the world and I’m
not!” she broke in, her indignation driving back the
tears.
</p>
<p>
“Isabel, you’re simply priceless to me!”
</p>
<p>
“But, if I hadn’t happened to meet you, I suppose
I’d be a nonentity!” she flashed back at him. “I’m
just a piece of property that you happen to like, and—why,
Harry Beckford, men insure property, don’t
they?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, but—”
</p>
<p>
“And I’m not worth insuring, even as property!”
she wailed. “Oh, I didn’t think you could ever be so
cruel, so heartless! You might at least let me think
I’m worth something.”
</p>
<p>
The young husband was in despair. He argued,
pleaded, explained in vain; she could only see that he
put a value on his life that he did not put on hers,
and it hurt her pride. Besides, they were partners in
everything else, so why not in insurance?
</p>
<p>
“But I wouldn’t want the insurance on your life,”
he urged.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think I’m any more mercenary than you?”
she retorted. “I don’t want the insurance, either; I
want you—when you’re nice to me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll think it over,” he said wearily.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve thought,” she returned decisively. “If it’s
such a good thing, I think you’re mean not to let me
share it with you.” Then, with sudden cheerfulness:
“It would be rather jolly and exciting to go together,
just as we go to the theater and—and—all other
amusements.”
</p>
<p>
He laughed at her classification of life insurance
among the pleasures of life, and then he kissed her
again. Her unreasoning opposition distressed him,
but resentment was quite out of the question. There
was momentary exasperation, and then a little love-making,
to bring the smiles back to her face. All else
could wait.
</p>
<p>
It is a noteworthy fact, however, that life insurance
takes a strong hold on a man the moment he really decides
he ought to have it, and opposition only adds to
his determination. He who finds that, because of some
unsuspected physical failing, he can not get it, immediately
is possessed with a mania for it. So long
as he considered it within his reach, he turned the
agents away; now he goes to them and lies and pleads
and tries desperately to gain that which he did not
want until he found he could not get it.
</p>
<p>
Thus, in a minor degree, the opposition of Beckford’s
wife served only to impress on Beckford’s mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
the necessity and advantage of some such provision
for the future. Perhaps the explanation of this is that
in trying to convince her he had convinced himself.
At any rate, the subject, at first taken up in a desultory
way, became one of supreme importance to
him, and he went to see Dave Murray. Dave, he was
solemnly informed by a friend who claimed to know,
probably had been christened David, but the last syllable
of the name had not been able to stand the wear
and tear of a strenuous life, in addition to which Murray
was not the kind of man to invite formality. He
was “Dave” to every one who got past the “Mr. Murray”
stage, and it never took long to do that. “Anyhow,”
his informant concluded, “you have a talk with
him. There isn’t a better fellow or a more upright
man in the city. The only thing I’ve got against him
is that he’ll insure a fellow while he isn’t looking and
then make him think he likes it. But if you want insurance,
go to him.” So Beckford went, and presently
he found himself telling Murray a great deal more
than he had intended to tell him.
</p>
<p>
“The fact is,” he explained, “my wife was violently
opposed to the idea at first.”
</p>
<p>
“Not unusual,” said Murray, and then he added
sententiously: “Wives don’t care for insurance, but
widows do.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
</p>
<p>
Beckford smiled as he saw the point.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t do a widow much good to care for insurance,
if she objected to it as a wife,” he suggested.
</p>
<p>
“It may,” returned Murray. “It isn’t at all necessary
that a wife should know what’s coming to her
when she becomes a widow. She may be provided for
in spite of herself.”
</p>
<p>
“That would be rather difficult in my case,” said
Beckford, “for my wife knows just what my salary is,
and we plan our expenditures together. It’s a pretty
good salary, but we have been living right up to the
limit of it, so I can’t provide for premiums without
her knowledge, although I can do it easily with it.”
</p>
<p>
“That complicates matters a little,” remarked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Besides,” Beckford added, “we have been so frank
with each other that I should be unhappy with such
a life-secret, and, if I acted on my own judgment and
took the policy home to her, she says she would tear
it up and throw it away.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew a woman to do that once,” said Murray reflectively.
“Her husband insured his life before going
on the excursion that ended in the Ashtabula disaster.
A few days later her little boy came in to ask if anything
could be done about the policy that she had destroyed.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think Isabel would really destroy it,” said
the troubled Beckford, “but it would distress her very
much to have me go so contrary to her wishes in a
matter that we had discussed.”
</p>
<p>
“It would distress her very much to be left penniless,”
remarked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I think,” said Beckford thoughtfully, “I really
think, if I had known that she was going to take this
view of the matter, I would have insured myself first
and talked to her about it afterward. Then the situation
wouldn’t be so awkward. But I thought that all
women favored life insurance.”
</p>
<p>
“Not at first,” returned Murray, “but usually there
comes a change.”
</p>
<p>
“When?” asked Beckford hopefully.
</p>
<p>
“When they begin to think of the needs and the
future and the possible hardships of the first baby,”
replied Murray, whereat Beckford blushed a little,
even as his wife had done a few days before, for
young people do not consider and discuss prospective
family problems with the same candor that their elders
do.
</p>
<p>
“Woman, the true woman,” Murray continued, “is
essentially unselfish; she thinks of others. Careless for
her own future, she plans painstakingly for those she
loves. The insurance premium that is for her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
benefit she would rather have to spend now, but you
never hear her object to the investment of any money
that is to benefit her husband or children, even when
she has to make sacrifices to permit it.”
</p>
<p>
“But that doesn’t help me,” complained Beckford.
“I don’t want any insurance on her life; I don’t need
it, and there is no reason to think that I ever shall
need it. It’s for her that I am planning, but she won’t
listen to anything but this dual arrangement.”
</p>
<p>
“I quite understand the situation,” returned Murray.
“What insurance you are able to take out must
be to protect her.”
</p>
<p>
“Precisely; and I never knew before that a woman
could be so unreasoningly wilful in opposition to her
own interests.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear sir,” said Murray, with some feeling,
“you have a great deal to learn about women. I have
more than twenty thousand dollars charged up to
them in commissions that I have lost, after convincing
the men interested. But if I can help you to provide
for this one perverse sample of femininity, in spite
of herself, I shall feel that I have taken a Christian
revenge on the whole sex.” Beckford rather objected
to this reference to his wife, but there was nothing of
disrespect in the tone, and somehow the quaintness of
the sentiment made him smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” Murray went on, “if we could refuse
the risk without frightening her.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid not,” returned Beckford, “but”—and
a sudden inspiration lighted his face, “couldn’t you
put in some restrictions that would frighten her
away?”
</p>
<p>
Murray leaned back in his chair and gave the
matter thoughtful consideration. Somehow he had
become unusually interested in this young man’s effort
to do a wise and generous thing for his wife in
the face of her opposition. If the man had been seeking
to gain some benefit for himself, Murray would
not have listened to even a suggestion of deceit. But
the aim was entirely unselfish, and Beckford had
brought a letter of introduction that left no doubt
as to his responsibility and integrity. Then, too, the
situation was amusing. Here were two business men
plotting—what? Why, the welfare of their opponent,
and that only.
</p>
<p>
“So many women have beaten me,” said Murray
at last, “that I should really like to beat one of them,
especially when it’s for her own good. Bring your
wife up here, and I’ll see what I can do.”
</p>
<p>
But here again feminine capriciousness was exemplified.
Having apparently won her point, Isabel
Beckford began to wish she had lost it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid,” she said. “Suppose I should find
that something frightful was the matter with me?
Those insurance doctors are awfully particular, and—and—I’d
rather not know it, if I’m going to die
very soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very well,” acquiesced her husband. “We’ll
go back to my original plan and put the whole ten
thousand dollars on my life.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no!” she protested. “It would be even
worse, if I learned that there was anything wrong
with you. I couldn’t bear it, Harry; I couldn’t, really!
There wouldn’t be anything left in life for me.
Let’s not go at all.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s foolish, Isabel,” he argued. “I’m all right,
and the very fact that I am accepted as a good risk
will remove every doubt.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so,” she admitted. “We’ll be sure, then,
won’t we?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course.”
</p>
<p>
“Then we’ll both go,” she announced, with a sudden
reversal of judgment. “I hadn’t thought of it
that way, but I’ll feel a lot better and stronger when
I’m insured, because the companies are so particular,
and it will be comforting to know that you are all
right. It’s worth something to find that out, isn’t it?
And sometimes a family physician won’t tell you the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
truth, because it won’t do any good and he doesn’t
want to frighten you. We’ll go right away and see
about it now.”
</p>
<p>
“Hardly this evening,” he answered, smiling, although
he was sorely troubled. “We’ll go to-morrow
afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
“But it’s so long to wait until to-morrow,” she
pouted.
</p>
<p>
He regretted the delay quite as much as she did,
for his experience up to date led him to think that
there might be another change. First she had refused
to consider the matter at all; then she had insisted
they should go together; after that she had backed
out; next she had demanded he should give up the
idea, also; and now she was again determined it should
be a joint affair.
</p>
<p>
“No man,” he muttered, as he dropped off to sleep,
“knows anything about a woman until he marries, and
then he only learns enough to know that he knows
nothing at all.”
</p>
<p>
Then he mentally apologized to his wife for even
this mild criticism, and dreamed that, through some
complication, he had to insure the cook and the janitor
and the grocer’s boy before he could take out a policy
on his own life, and that, when he had attended to
the rest, he had no money left for his own premiums,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
so he made all the other policies in favor of his wife
and hoped to thunder that the cook and the janitor
and the grocer’s boy would die a long time before he
did.
</p>
<p>
However, she was still of the same mind the next
day, so they went to see Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” she said, as they were on the way, “if
this thing wrecks our happiness by showing that the
grave is yawning for either of us, it will be all your
fault.”
</p>
<p>
That made him feel nice and comfortable—so nice
and comfortable that he heartily wished he never had
mentioned life insurance. Still, he cheered up a little
when Murray took charge of matters in a masterly,
confident way.
</p>
<p>
“I understand, Mrs. Beckford,” said Murray, “that
both you and your husband wish to have your lives
insured.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she replied, “and for some reason he has
selfishly wanted to put all the insurance we can afford
on his own life.”
</p>
<p>
“So he has told me.”
</p>
<p>
“What right had he to discuss family matters with
you?” she demanded with asperity.
</p>
<p>
Thus Murray was jarred out of his air of easy
confidence the first thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—why, he didn’t exactly tell me,” he explained,
“but my experience enabled me to surmise
as much. Most men are like that.”
</p>
<p>
“I never thought Harry would be,” she said, looking
at him reproachfully. “But it’s all right now,”
she added.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s all right now,” repeated Murray. He had
intended to argue first the advisability of accepting
her husband’s plan, but he deemed it unwise. He had
suddenly lost faith in his powers of persuasion, so he
resorted to guile. “Of course, you understand that
life insurance is hedged about by many annoying restrictions,”
he went on.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know it,” she returned.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes,” he said glibly, with a wink at Beckford.
“Do you use gasoline at all?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I have used it occasionally to take a spot
out of a gown,” she admitted.
</p>
<p>
“Barred!” asserted Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t do even the least little mite of cleaning with
gasoline!” she exclaimed in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“None at all! It’s dangerous! Might just as well
fool with nitroglycerin. People who handle it at all
become careless.”
</p>
<p>
There were indications of a rising temper. That a
mean old insurance company should have the audacity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
to tell her what she could or could not do was an outrage!
</p>
<p>
“And you can’t use street-cars,” added Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t use street-cars!” she cried. “What will
Harry do?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that rule doesn’t apply to men,” returned
Murray calmly, “for men don’t get off the cars backward
and all that sort of thing. Street-cars are considered,
in our business, a danger only for women.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a hateful, insulting, unfair business!”
she cried, rising in her indignation. “I wouldn’t let
such a contemptible lot of people insure me for anything
in the world.”
</p>
<p>
“But please don’t blame me,” urged Murray insinuatingly.
“I want to do the best I can for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I don’t blame you,” she returned magnanimously.
</p>
<p>
“I admit that it sounds unfair,” Murray persisted,
“but there was a time when we wouldn’t take risks on
women at all, so, even with the restrictions, it’s quite
a concession.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very likely, very likely,” she admitted, “but
I have too much pride to accept any such humiliating
conditions. Harry can do as he pleases,” with
dignity, “but nothing could induce me to be insured
now. I’m going home.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
Harry took her to a cab, and then returned to Murray’s
office.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s settled,” said Murray, with a sigh of
relief.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s settled,” returned Beckford, “but I don’t
feel just comfortable about it.”
</p>
<p>
“She sort of bowled me over the first thing,” commented
Murray. “I haven’t quite recovered yet. But
it’s her welfare that we’re considering. Better put in
your application and take the examination before
there are any more complications.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that’s wise,” admitted Beckford gloomily,
for he was not at all at ease about the matter. She
had said he could do as he pleased, but there had
been something in her tone that was disquieting; she
might think there was disloyalty in his patronage of
a company that had so offended her. And this was
the first cloud that had appeared in the matrimonial
sky; in all else there had been mutual concession and
perfect agreement.
</p>
<p>
He was thinking of this when he went home—and
found her in tears.
</p>
<p>
“I know what’s the matter,” she wailed. “I didn’t
think of it at first, but I did afterward, and I’ve been
crying ever since. I have heart trouble; that’s why
he didn’t want to give me a policy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense!” he protested vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I know it! I know it!” she cried. “He didn’t
want to tell me, so he put in all that about street-cars
and gasoline. But it’s heart trouble or consumption!
Those insurance men are so quick to see things that no
one else notices. Why, I could see that he was worried
the very first thing!”
</p>
<p>
Beckford got on his knees beside the bed on which
she was lying and tried to comfort her, but she was
inconsolable. He insisted that she was the strongest
and healthiest woman of her size in the world; that
he knew it; that Murray himself had commented on
it later; that the company physician, who happened
to be in the outer office as they passed through, had
spoken of it; that even the clerks were impressed; but
he failed to shake her conviction that she had some
fatal, and hitherto unsuspected, malady. Finally, assuring
her that he would have that matter settled in
thirty minutes, he rushed to the nearest cab-stand and
gave the driver double fare to run his horse all the
way to Murray’s house.
</p>
<p>
Murray was just sitting down to dinner, but Beckford
insisted that he should return with him immediately.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got to straighten this matter out!” he told
him excitedly. “You’ve got to give her all the insurance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
she wants without any restrictions! Make it fifty
thousand dollars if she wants it! I’ll pay the premiums,
if we have to starve!”
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t give her a policy to-night!” protested
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“You can tell her about it to-night, can’t you?”
demanded Beckford. “And you can take her application
to-night, can’t you? Why, man, she has convinced
herself that she’s going to die in a week! We
can settle the details later, but we’ve got to do something
to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, I’ll come immediately after dinner,” said
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“You come now!” cried Beckford. “If you talk
dinner to me, I’ll brain you! Insurance has made a
wreck of me already.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t been getting much joy out of this particular
case myself,” grumbled Murray, but he went
along.
</p>
<p>
The moment he reached home, Beckford rushed to
his wife’s room.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all a mistake!” he exclaimed joyfully. “You—you
mustn’t cry any more, dearest, for it’s all
right now. Mr. Murray didn’t understand at first—thought
you were one of these capricious, careless,
thoughtless women that do all sorts of absurd and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
foolish things on impulse—but he knows better now.
There aren’t any more restrictions for you than for
me, and he’s waiting in the parlor to take your application
for all the insurance you want.”
</p>
<p>
“Really?” she asked, as the sobs began to subside.
</p>
<p>
“Really.”
</p>
<p>
“And there isn’t anything the matter with me?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not, sweetheart.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, after a pause, “I can’t see him
now, because my eyes are all red, but I wish he’d write
that out for me. I’d feel so much more comfortable.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed he will,” asserted Beckford, “and we can
fill out the application in here, and I’ll take it back to
him.”
</p>
<p>
Hopefully and happily the young husband returned
to Murray and told him what was wanted.
Murray sighed dismally. He had missed his dinner
for a woman’s whim, and the woman was merely humiliating
him. Still, he felt in a measure responsible
for the trouble; he ought never to have resorted to
duplicity, even for so laudable a purpose. So he
wrote the following: “Investigation has convinced
me that the restrictions mentioned this afternoon are
unnecessary in your case, and I shall be glad to have
your application for insurance on the same terms as
your husband’s.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Beckford read this over carefully. Then she
read the application blank with equal care. After that
she wrote at the bottom of the note: “Insurance has
almost given me nervous prostration now, and I don’t
want to have anything more to do with it. If Harry
can stand the strain, let him have it all.”
</p>
<p>
“Give him that, Harry,” she said, “and get rid of
him as soon as possible, for I want you to come back
and comfort me. I’m completely upset.”
</p>
<p>
Murray lit a cigar when he reached the street, and
puffed at it meditatively as he walked in the direction
of the nearest street-car line.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter with nervous prostration for
me?” he muttered. “One more effort to defeat a
woman who is fighting against her own interests will
make me an impossible risk in any company; two more
will land me in a sanatorium.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span><a name='c2' id='c2'></a>AN INCIDENTAL QUESTION</h2>
<p>
Dave Murray, general agent, leaned back in his
chair and looked thoughtfully at the young man before
him.
</p>
<p>
“So you have run up against an unanswerable argument?”
he remarked.
</p>
<p>
“It seems so to me,” said the inexperienced Owen
Ross.
</p>
<p>
“My dear boy,” asserted Murray, “in the life insurance
business the only unanswerable argument is a
physician’s report that the applicant is not a good
risk. What is the particular thing that has put you
down and out?”
</p>
<p>
“Faith,” replied the young man; “just plain faith
in the Almighty. Perhaps, some time in your career,
you have run across a religious enthusiast who considers
it a reflection on the all-seeing wisdom of the
Almighty to take any measures for his own protection
or the protection of his family.”
</p>
<p>
“I have,” admitted Murray, “but generally it has
been a woman.”
</p>
<p>
“This is a man,” said Ross; “a sincere, devout man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
If he were a hypocrite, it would be different, but it is
a matter of religious conviction—a principle of faith—with
him to trust in the Lord. Life insurance he
considers almost sacrilegious—an evidence of man’s
doubt in the wisdom of his Maker, and an attempt, in
his puny insignificant way, to interfere with the plans
of the Great Master. To all arguments he replies,
‘The Lord will provide for His children.’”
</p>
<p>
“And you consider that unanswerable?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“In his case, yes. Even his wife is unable to move
him, although she wants insurance as a provision for
the future of the children and was instrumental in
getting me to talk to him. How would you answer
such a contention as that?”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t answer it; I would agree with him.”
</p>
<p>
“And give up?”
</p>
<p>
“Quite the contrary. While there can be no doubt
that he is right as far as he goes, he does not go far
enough. I would turn his own argument against him.”
Murray leaned forward in his chair and spoke with
earnest deliberation. “The Lord provides for His
children through human instrumentality. Why should
not the man be the human instrument through which
the Lord provides for that man’s family? The Lord
does not directly intervene—at least, not in these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
days. If, in the hour of extremity, an unexpected
legacy should come to relieve the necessities of that
man’s family, he would say the Lord had provided.
But it would be through human instrumentality: the
legacy, and the method and law by which it reached
them would be essentially human. If, when poverty
knocks at the door, some generous philanthropist were
moved to come to their relief, he would hold again that
the Lord had provided; if some wealthy relative
sought them out, it would be through the intervention
of the Lord; if, through his own wise action, they are
saved from want, is he more than the human instrument
through which the Lord provides? May not an
insurance company be the chosen instrument? I say
this with all due reverence, and it seems to me to answer
his objections fully. Is it only in unforeseen
ways that He cares for His children? Has He nothing
to do with those cases in which reasonable precautions
are taken by the children themselves?”
</p>
<p>
Ross, the young solicitor, looked at his chief with
unconcealed admiration.
</p>
<p>
“By George!” he exclaimed, “you’ve got the theory
of this business down to a science. I’ll try the man
again.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not a business,” retorted Murray somewhat
warmly, for this was a point that touched his pride;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
“it is a profession—at least, it lies with the man himself
to make it a business or a profession, according to
his own ability and character. There are small men
who make a business of the law, and there are great
men who make a profession of it; there are doctors to
whom medicine is a mere commercial pursuit, and
there are doctors to whom it is a study, a science, a
profession. You may make of life insurance a cheap
business, or you may make of it a dignified profession;
you may be a mere annoying canvasser, or you may
be a man who commands respect; but, to be really
successful, you must have, or acquire, a technical
knowledge of the basis of insurance, a knowledge of
law, and, above all, a knowledge of human nature,—and
even that will avail little if you are not temperamentally
suited to the work. You can no more make
a good insurance man of unpromising material than
you can make a good artist.”
</p>
<p>
Ross caught some of the enthusiasm and earnestness
of Murray, and unconsciously straightened up.
</p>
<p>
“You have made me look at the subject from a new
point of view,” he said. “I confess I was rather
ashamed of the soliciting part of the work at first—felt
a good deal like a cripple selling pencils to support
a sick wife.”
</p>
<p>
“And very likely you acted like it,” remarked Murray,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
“in which case the people you approached would
so class you. It isn’t necessary to have the ‘iron nerve,’
so long identified with that branch of the work; it
isn’t even helpful, for it makes a man unpopular, and
the most successful men are the most popular ones.
You’ve lost ground when you have reached a point
where any man you know is not glad to see you enter
his office. At the same time,”—musingly,—“nerve
and persistence become forethought and wisdom when
time proves you were right. I have known of cases
where a man afterward thanked the solicitor who had
once made life a burden to him; but it is always better
to change a man’s mind without his knowledge.”
</p>
<p>
“Rather difficult,” laughed Ross.
</p>
<p>
“But it has been done,” said Murray. “As a matter
of fact, you are working to save men and women from
their own selfishness or heedlessness. If you think of
that, you will be more convincing and will raise your
work to the dignity of a profession; if you think only
of the commissions, you will put yourself on the level
of the shyster lawyer whose interest centers wholly in
the fees he is able to get rather than in the cases he is
to try. There are pot-boilers in every business and
every profession, but success is not for them: they
can’t see beyond the needs of the stomach, and the
man who works only for his belly never amounts to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
much. He will stoop to small things to gain a temporary
advantage, never seeing the future harm he
is doing; he is the kind of man who hopes to rise by
pulling others down. Remember, my boy, that insinuations
as to the instability of a rival company invariably
make a man suspicious of all: when you have
convinced him that the rival’s proposition and methods
are not based on sound financial and business principles,
you have more than half convinced him that
yours aren’t, either, and that very likely there is something
radically wrong with the whole blame system.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you spoke of that,” said Ross. “There
have been cases where insinuations have been made
against our company, and I have been tempted to
fight back the same way. A man is at a disadvantage
when he is put on the defensive and is called upon to
produce evidence of what ought to be a self-evident
proposition.”
</p>
<p>
“Never do it, unless the question is put to you
directly,” advised Murray. “You must defend yourself
when attacked, but, in every other case, go on the
assumption that your company is all right, and that
everybody knows it is all right. The late John J.
Ingalls once said, ‘When you have to offer evidence
that an egg is good, that egg is doubtful, and a doubtful
egg is always bad.’ It’s worth remembering.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
Many a man is made doubtful of a good proposition
by ill-advised efforts to prove it is good.”
</p>
<p>
“If that is invariably true,”—with a troubled scowl,—“I
fear I have made some mistakes.”
</p>
<p>
“The man who thinks he makes no mistakes seldom
makes anything else.”
</p>
<p>
Ross brightened perceptibly at this.
</p>
<p>
“You’ve made them yourself?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Lots of them,” replied Murray, and then he added
whimsically: “Once I placed a risk that meant a two-hundred-dollar
commission for me, and my wife and
I went right out and ordered two hundred dollars’
worth of furniture and clothes. The risk was refused,
and I never got the commission.”
</p>
<p>
Ross laughed.
</p>
<p>
“I’m beginning to develop enthusiasm and pride in
the business—I mean profession.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, call it a business,” returned Murray, “but
think of it as a profession. It’s the way you regard it
yourself that counts, and you can’t go far astray in
that if you stop to think what is required of a good
insurance man. Sterling integrity, for one thing, and
tact and judgment. A man who brings in a good ten-thousand-dollar
risk is more valuable than the man
who brings in one hundred thousand dollars that is
turned down by the physicians or at the home office.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
And the first requisite for advancement is absolute
trustworthiness. There are temptations, even for a
solicitor—commission rebates to the insured that are
contrary to the ethics of the business—and there are
greater temptations higher up. You will learn, as in
no other line, that a man wants what he can’t get,
even if he didn’t want it when he could get it, and he
will pay a high price for what he wants. Collusion
in a local office might give it to him, in spite of all
precautions taken; such collusion might be worth ten
thousand dollars to a man who had no record of refusal
by other companies against him, and ten thousand
dollars could be split up very nicely between the
local agent and the company’s physician. So integrity,
unswerving integrity, is rated exceptionally
high, and the least suspicion of trickery or underhand
dealing may keep a capable man on the lowest
rung of the ladder for all time, even if it doesn’t put
him out of the business entirely. You are paid to protect
your company, so far as lies in your power, and
to get business by all honorable means; if you resort
to dishonorable means, even in your company’s interests,
there is always the suspicion that you will use
the same methods against its interests whenever that
may be to your personal advantage.”
</p>
<p>
Owen Ross pondered this deeply on his way home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
It gave a new dignity to his occupation. He had
taken up insurance because it happened to be the only
available opening at a time when he was out of employment.
He had been a clerk for a big corporation
that had recently combined two branch offices, thus
materially reducing its office force, and Ross had been
one of those to suffer. His father, a prosperous merchant,
had expressed himself, when consulted, in this
way:
</p>
<p>
“I will give you a place here whenever that is necessary
to enable you to live, but I prefer that you
should complete your preliminary business training
under some one else. No boy can consider himself a
success until he has proved his independence, and no
boy can be sure he has proved that until he has made
a secure place for himself outside the family circle.”
</p>
<p>
So Ross, being wise enough to see the reason and
justice of this, endeavored to show his independence
by securing a position with Murray. And, although
fairly successful from the start, he was only just beginning
to take a real interest in his work. Murray
liked him and encouraged him: there was, he thought,
the making of a good and successful man in him, and
he frequently went to considerable trouble to explain
the theory and practice of insurance. Then, too, he
knew that Ross had married just before he lost his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
other position, and that he was living in a modest
little flat on his own earnings, in spite of the fact that
he had a father who would be much more ready to
assist him financially than he was to take him into his
own office at that particular time. In fact, the elder
Ross was quite willing that his son and his son’s wife
should live with him, holding only that the family
influence should not extend to his first business connections,
but Owen deemed the flat a necessary evidence
of his independence.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get that sanctimonious optimist to-morrow,”
he mused as he walked along. “He can’t answer those
arguments that Murray gave me. He is content because
the Lord will provide, but why may not I be the
human instrument through which the Lord makes provision?
That sounds presumptuous, but why not?
Hasn’t He provided for others in just this way?
Hasn’t many a man, convinced against his will, protected
the future of those he loved barely in time?”
He laughed quietly at a thought that occurred to him.
“If this man should be insured to-morrow and die the
next day,” he went on, “he would think the Lord had
provided, but if he has to pay the premiums for
twenty years, he’ll think it all very human. I’m beginning
to understand him.”
</p>
<p>
He was still smiling at this quaint conceit when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
entered his flat and was informed by his wife that Mrs.
Becker had been there to see him. Mrs. Becker was
a woman who did washing and occasional cleaning for
them.
</p>
<p>
“To see me!” he exclaimed. “Why, her dealings
are all with you.”
</p>
<p>
“It has something to do with insurance,” his wife
explained. “She knows you’re in that business, of
course, and she is in deep distress. She was crying
when she was here this afternoon, but I couldn’t understand
what the trouble was. She said she’d come
back this evening.”
</p>
<p>
Ross puzzled over this a good deal during dinner,
and even tried to get some additional information by
questioning his wife closely. Exactly what did the
woman say? Her words might be “all Greek” to his
wife and still be intelligible to him, if only she could
repeat them.
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t,” she insisted. “I was so sorry for her
and so helpless that I really didn’t hear it all, anyway.
I only know that it had something to do with an application
or a premium or a policy, and her husband
is very sick and she needs money.”
</p>
<p>
Ross began to speculate. The ignorant have
strange ideas of insurance, and very likely this woman
thought she could insure a dying husband. His backbone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
began to stiffen at once. Of course such a thing
was actually, as well as ethically, impossible, but it
was going to be a very difficult matter to explain it
to her, and he anticipated a distressing scene. His
wife was interested in the woman, spoke frequently
of her hardships and her courage, and had helped her
to such trifling extent as they could afford. No doubt
the woman had some wild notion that he, being an insurance
man, could do this for her and would do it as
a matter of charity. Ethical questions do not trouble
such people.
</p>
<p>
When she came, he was prepared for a request that
was impossible in honor and in fact, and he was ready
to refuse it with such gentleness as he deemed due to
a weary and desperate woman who did not realize what
she was asking—the gentleness of sympathy coupled
with the firmness of principle. Ross was a young man,
inclined to exaggerate the importance and difficulties
of problems that confronted him, and he was disconcerted
when he found he had made an error in the
basis from which he had reached his conclusion; the
woman did not wish to insure a dying husband, but
to protect insurance he already carried.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, good Mr. Ross,” she wailed, “you must fix it
for me some way. If we don’t pay to-morrow, we’ll
lose everything. And we haven’t the money, Mr. Ross,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
not enough to pay the doctor even, and it’s worrying
Peter more than the sickness. But you can fix it for
us—of course you can fix it for us,”—with appealing
hopefulness.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down, Mrs. Becker, and tell me about it,” he
urged. “I don’t understand.”
</p>
<p>
She sank into a chair, and looked at him with
anxious, tearful doubt and hope. Worn out with work
and watching, she was a prey to conflicting emotions.
Never doubting that he could help her, she feared he
might refuse. Her anxiety was pitiable, and it was
some time before he could get the details of the story
from her. Finally, however, he learned that in more
prosperous days her husband had insured his life for
five thousand dollars, and, even in adversity, had succeeded
in keeping up the payments, until stricken by
this last illness. The sum he had saved up for the
next premium—the one due the following day—had
been used for medicines and other necessaries, and now
he was near death. The doctor held out no hope; he
might live a few days, but hardly more than that, for
he was slowly but surely sinking. Until the previous
night, when there came a turn for the worse, his recovery
had been confidently expected, and his wife
had worried little about the premium; the insurance
company would be glad to take it when he was well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
“But <em>he</em> worried,” she said with unconscious pathos;
“he worried and asked about it until—he couldn’t any
more. He’s too sick to know now. But,”—hopefully,—“he’ll
understand when I tell him it’s all right.”
</p>
<p>
Ross was as much distressed as the woman, but he
could give her little comfort. He could protect the
insurance only by paying the premium himself, and
he was not able to do that. Still, almost all policies
provided for the payment of something proportionate
to the amount paid in, even when the premiums were
not kept up, so—He paused uncomfortably at this
point, for the woman’s attitude and expression had
changed from tearful anxiety to dull, sullen suspicion.
She did not believe him; like all insurance men, he was
ready to seize any opportunity to defraud her; she
was helpless, and a rich company would take advantage
of her helplessness.
</p>
<p>
“You can get the money, Owen,” his wife urged,
almost in tears herself.
</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>
“I’ll pay it back to you—when he dies!” cried the
woman, and Ross gave her a quick glance. It seemed
heartless, but he saw it was not. The woman was tried
beyond her endurance; she, with her two children,
faced a future that was absolutely devoid of hope; she
was sick, wretched, despairing, and the husband she
had striven so hard to keep with her was already
beyond recall. She spoke of his approaching death
merely as something certain, that could not be prevented,
and that force of circumstances compelled her
to consider. She had to think for herself and children,
plan for herself and children, even at this fearful time,
for there was no one to do it for her, no one to relieve
her of any part of the burden. The problem of the
larder and the problem of burial would confront her
simultaneously; she had to face these cold, hard,
brutal facts, in spite of the grief and sorrow of the
moment.
</p>
<p>
All this Ross saw and appreciated, and he gave his
attention to various possible ways of raising the necessary
money.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I can arrange it,” he said at last. “In
what company is he insured?”
</p>
<p>
It proved to be his own company. Instantly, his
talk with Murray flashed through his mind. “You are
paid to protect your company, so far as lies in your
power,” Murray had said. Absolute loyalty to its interests
was imperative. Would it be honorable for
him to enter into any arrangement with this woman
that would cost his company money? Had he any
right to do more than the company would do itself?
What would be thought of an employee in any other
line of business who advanced money that was to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
used to the financial disadvantage of his employer,
however proper it might be in the case of some one
else?
</p>
<p>
“I can do nothing,” he announced shortly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Owen!” cried his wife reproachfully.
</p>
<p>
“It is impossible!” he insisted. “If it were a proper
thing to do, Murray would do it for her himself.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Murray doesn’t understand the situation,”
urged his wife.
</p>
<p>
“Murray would understand my situation and his,”
he returned. “We are taking money from this company,
we are its trusted agents, and we can not do
anything that would be to its disadvantage. It is a
matter of business integrity.”
</p>
<p>
The woman did not weep now, but the look she gave
him haunted him all that night. And his wife’s entreaties
and reproaches added to his unhappiness.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Jennie,” he explained, “I stand alone between
the company and a loss of over four thousand
dollars. I know that this man is dying; I know that,
if I pay this premium, the company will have to pay
out the full amount of the insurance within a few
days; I know that the premiums paid to date amount
to only about five hundred or six hundred dollars,
which, under the terms of the policy, the woman will
not wholly lose. For me, an employee, to conspire to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
get the rest of the money for her would be like taking
it from the cash drawer. I won’t do it; I can’t do it
after Murray’s talk to me to-day about business integrity!”
</p>
<p>
“The company can afford it,” persisted Mrs. Ross,
“and the woman needs it so badly.”
</p>
<p>
“There are lots of companies and individuals who
could afford to let the woman have five thousand dollars,”
replied Ross.
</p>
<p>
Still, Mrs. Ross could not understand. If he had
been willing to pay the premium to another company,
why not to his own?
</p>
<p>
“Resign and pay it!” she exclaimed suddenly, feeling
that she had solved the problem; but that was a
greater sacrifice than he was prepared to make. He
was sincerely sorry for the woman; the case was on his
mind all the following morning; but Murray’s talk
had made a deep impression. This was one of the
severe temptations of the business—the more severe
because there was no question of corruption, but only
of sympathy, in it. Such, he had read, were the
temptations that led men of the best intentions astray
in many of the affairs of life.
</p>
<p>
He was thinking of this when he called to see the
“sanctimonious optimist”; he was thinking of it when
he advanced the arguments Murray had given him;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
he was still thinking of it when the man said he was
almost convinced and would telephone him after talking
with his wife. Consequently, this success failed to
elate him.
</p>
<p>
“The law of humanity,” he told himself, “is higher
and more sacred than the law of business.”
</p>
<p>
He had walked unconsciously in the direction of his
father’s office, and, still arguing with himself, he
went in.
</p>
<p>
“Father,” he said, “I want to borrow a hundred
dollars.” The premium was a little more than that,
but he could supply the remainder.
</p>
<p>
“For what?” asked the senior Ross.
</p>
<p>
“There is something I may wish to do,” was the
enigmatical reply. “I will repay it as rapidly as possible.”
</p>
<p>
“Commissions few and small?” laughed the senior
Ross. “Well, a young man never finds out exactly
what he’s worth, while working for a relative or a
friend, so this experience ought to be valuable.”
</p>
<p>
Still undecided, but with the money in his pocket,
Ross left his father’s office and went to his own. He
wanted to pay that premium, but it seemed to him a
very serious matter, ethically and actually. The
woman faced a future of privation; he faced what
seemed to him a crisis in his business career. He revolted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
at the thought of being false to his employer,
but to let the woman suffer would be heartless.
</p>
<p>
“A letter for you, Ross,” said one of the clerks, as
he entered the office. “Your wife left it.”
</p>
<p>
He opened it with nervous haste, and a notice of a
premium due dropped out.
</p>
<p>
“You must find some way to help this woman,
Owen,” his wife wrote. “I went to see her to-day, and
the situation is pitiable. She has used up every cent
she had and is in debt. Her husband is conscious at
intervals, and he looks at you so wistfully, so anxiously,
that it makes your heart bleed. Oh! if I could
only tell him that the insurance is all right! It
would give him peace for the little time that is left to
him on this earth. <em>Owen! resign, if necessary, but do
what I ask!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Ross crumpled the note in his hand and walked into
Murray’s private office.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Murray,” he said, “please accept my verbal
resignation.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I have no time to explain now,” said Ross. “I
want to be released from my obligations to the company
at once.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re excited,” said Murray. “Sit down! Now,
what’s the matter?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
Ross hesitated a moment, and then blurted out the
whole story.
</p>
<p>
“You wish to pay this premium?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to pay it!” said Ross defiantly. “It will
stick the company for more than four thousand dollars,
but I’m going to pay it!”
</p>
<p>
“And you wish to resign to do it honorably?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Pay it!” said Murray. “But your resignation is
not accepted. I wouldn’t lose such a man as you for
ten times four thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“It is all right?” asked Ross, bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“Of course it’s all right,” asserted Murray. “As a
matter of sympathy and justice, it is not only right
but highly commendable; as a matter of financial
profit to you, it would be despicable. Pay that premium,
and I tell you now that the company will never
pay a death benefit with less hesitation than it will pay
this one. What is one risk more or less? We do business
on the general average, and any sum is well invested
that uncovers so conscientious an employee.
Pay it, and come back to me.”
</p>
<p>
Three minutes later, Ross, with the receipt in his
pocket, was at the telephone.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all right,” he told his wife. “The premium is
paid.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Owen!” exclaimed Mrs. Ross, and her voice
broke a little, “you don’t know what comfort you have
given a dying man! If you could only see—”
</p>
<p>
“Get a cab!” he broke in. “He doesn’t know it yet,
and you must tell him. Get a cab and drive like—”
</p>
<p>
He stopped short, but his wife knew what he almost
said, and she forgave him without even a preliminary
reproach.
</p>
<p>
His eyes were bright and his heart was light when
he went back to Murray. Mrs. Becker’s situation was
sad enough, but surely he had lessened the gloom of
it by removing one great source of anxiety. He felt
that he had done something worthy of a man, and it
was a joy that he could do this without transcending
the rules of business integrity and loyalty.
</p>
<p>
“I want you,” said Murray, and there was something
of admiration in his tone; “I want you so much
that I am going to put you in the way of making more
money. You have a great deal to learn about the insurance
business before you will cease making unnecessary
problems for yourself, but you have one quality
that makes you valuable to me.” He paused and smiled
a little at the recollection of what had passed. “I
would suggest,” he went on, “that you bear this in
mind: life insurance is not for one life only or for one
generation only, but for the centuries. Otherwise, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
could not do business on the present plan. We exist
by reducing the laws of chance to a science that makes
us secure in the long run, although, on the basis of a
single year, there may be considerable losses. And a
good company will no more stoop to shabby tricks
than you will; nor will it seek to escape obligations
through technicalities or petty subterfuges. That’s
why I told you to pay that premium, and I respect
you for doing it.”
</p>
<p>
Murray picked up a memorandum on his desk.
</p>
<p>
“By the way,” he added, glancing at it, “you must
have made good use of the arguments I gave you, for
your sanctimonious optimist telephoned that, if you
would call this afternoon or to-morrow, he would arrange
with you for a ten-thousand-dollar policy.”
</p>
<p>
Grateful as Murray’s praise was to his ears, the
greeting from his wife gave Ross the most joy.
</p>
<p>
“He was conscious for a moment and understood,”
she said, as she put her arms around her husband’s
neck, “and there was such an expression of restful
peace on his face that it made me happy, in spite of
the shadow of death hovering over. It made him a
little better, the doctor said, but nothing can save
him. And I’m so proud of you, Owen!”
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth, dearest,” he replied tenderly,
“I’m almost proud of myself.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span><a name='c3' id='c3'></a>AN INCIDENTAL TRAGEDY</h2>
<p>
Dave Murray stretched his legs comfortably under
the table, blew rings of smoke toward the ceiling, and
waited for Stanley Wentworth to speak.
</p>
<p>
Having his full share of worldly wisdom, Murray
knew that there was a reason for Wentworth’s most
urgent invitation to lunch with him at his club. While
they had been friends for years and had lunched together
on many previous occasions, there was a formality
about this invitation that presaged something
of importance. So, when they reached the cigars,
Murray smoked and waited.
</p>
<p>
“You win, Dave,” Wentworth announced at last.
</p>
<p>
“I knew I would—when you married,” returned
Murray. “It was only a question of time then.”
</p>
<p>
“Especially after you got the ear of my wife,” said
Wentworth. “You worked that very nicely, Dave.
Do you remember the story you told her about the
man who couldn’t give any time to life insurance during
the busy season and who was on his death-bed
when the date he had set for his examination arrived?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“It was true, too,” asserted Murray. “The man
was a good risk when I went after him, and there
would have been ten thousand dollars for his wife if
he hadn’t procrastinated. There’s no money in the
policy that a man was just going to take out, Stanley.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you win, anyway,” said Wentworth. “We’ve
been jollying each other on this insurance business
for six or eight years, and I’ve stood you off pretty
well, but I can’t stand against the little woman at
home. I was lost, Dave, the day I took you up to the
house and introduced you to her.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess I played the cards pretty well,” laughed
Murray. “I told you at the beginning that I was
going to insure you before I got through, and a good
insurance man doesn’t let a little matter like the personal
inclinations of his subject interfere with his
plans. Why, I’ve been known to put a man in a
trance, have him examined, and abstract the first premium
from his pocket before he waked up. But you
were the hardest proposition I ever tackled. You
ought to have taken out a policy ten years ago.”
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t see any reason for it,” explained Wentworth.
“I thought I was a confirmed bachelor: had
no family and never expected to have one. That was
at twenty-five, and at thirty I considered the matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
absolutely settled, but at thirty-five the little woman
just quietly reached out and took me into camp—and
I’m glad of it. Never knew what real life was before.
Still, I hate like thunder to surrender to you after
our long, harmonious and entertaining fight, Dave;
I wouldn’t do it if you hadn’t taken advantage of my
hospitality to load my wife up with insurance ghost
stories. If you want to be fair, you’ll pay her half
the commission.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do it!” exclaimed Murray; “not in cash, of
course, but I’ll make her a present that will cover it—something
nice for the house. You won’t be jealous,
will you?”
</p>
<p>
“Jealous!” returned Wentworth with a hearty
laugh. “Well, I guess not! Why, I’ll help out by
making the policy worth while: I’ll take out one for
twenty-five thousand. I tell you, Dave, I’m not going
to run any risk of leaving the little woman unprovided
for, and I lost four thousand in the last month.”
</p>
<p>
The conversation had been jocular, with an undercurrent
of seriousness in it, but Wentworth became
really serious with the last remark. Murray saw that
this loss had had more to do with the decision than
any arguments that had been advanced, and he, too,
dropped his bantering tone.
</p>
<p>
“I never could see,” Wentworth went on, “why insurance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
was any better than an investment in good
stock—”
</p>
<p>
“A little more certain,” suggested Murray, “so far
as your wife is concerned. No stock is safe while a
man lives and continues in business. It is too convenient
as collateral and can be reached too easily in
the case of failure. You will take risks with stock that
you will not take with insurance, even when you can;
you will sell stock to get ready cash for a business
venture that may prove disastrous, but it’s like robbing
your own widow to touch life insurance money.
No man ever raised money on his policy without feeling
meaner than a yellow dog, for he is gambling with
the future of the one he loves, or at least should love.
He has taken money that he promised her; money
that she will sadly need in case of his unexpected
death. That she consented to it does not ease his conscience,
if he is any sort of a man, for no woman ever
freely consents to jeopardizing any part of her husband’s
life insurance money; she is led to do it, against
her better judgment, by love and faith, and he knows
that he has demanded of her what may prove to be a
great sacrifice. That is why insurance is a better investment
than stocks for the purpose you have in
mind, Stanley; whatever your business needs, you
never can ask your wife to join you in hypothecating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
the policy without feeling like a mean heartless
sneak.”
</p>
<p>
“I never looked at in that way,” returned Wentworth
thoughtfully, “but you’re right, Dave. The
policy will have a sacredness that no stock can possess.
To touch it, to risk any part of it in business,
would seem like taking money out of the baby’s bank.
Still,” he added whimsically, “a game in which you
have to die to win never did appeal to me very
strongly.”
</p>
<p>
“A game in which you are sure to win when you
die is better than a game in which you are likely to
lose twice,” retorted Murray, “or one in which you
have to live to win, so long as life is something over
which you have no jurisdiction. With insurance you
win when you lose, but with stocks you may lose both
ways and leave nothing but a reputation for selfish
improvidence. Of course, I am looking at it from the
family, rather than the personal, point of view.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely,” acquiesced Wentworth. “I am thinking
of the little woman and the baby.” He settled back
in his chair and smoked dreamily for a few moments,
his thoughts evidently wandering to the home that
had given him so much of happiness during the last
eighteen months. And Murray was silent, too. The
affair was as much one of friendship as of business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
with him. It had been largely a joke when he had
first declared that he would write a policy on Wentworth’s
life, although he believed implicitly that
every man should have insurance and should get it
when he is young enough to secure a favorable rate.
At that time Wentworth had no one dependent upon
him, but Murray had kept at him in a bantering way,
telling him that he would surely have need of insurance
later and that he had better prepare for it while
the opportunity offered. Then, when celibacy seemed
to have become a permanent condition with him, he
had married, and thereafter, while still treating the
subject lightly and humorously, Murray had conducted
a campaign that was really founded on friendship.
No one knows better than a man who has been
long in the insurance business of the tragedies resulting
from procrastination and neglect; no one can better
appreciate how great a risk of such a tragedy a
friend may be running. So Murray, jolly but insinuating,
was actuated by something more than purely
business interest when he made whimsical references
to his long campaign in the presence of Mrs. Wentworth
and incidentally, apparently only to tease her
husband, described some of the sad little dramas of life
that had come to his notice. And he had won at last.
</p>
<p>
“Get the application ready,” said Wentworth, suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
rousing himself, “and let me know when your
doctor wants to see me.”
</p>
<p>
That evening Wentworth told his wife that he had
arranged to take out a twenty-five-thousand-dollar
policy, and she put her arms around his neck and
looked up at him in an anxious, troubled way.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t think I’m mercenary, do you, Stanley?”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed, I don’t, little woman,” he replied, as he
kissed her; “I think you are only wise.”
</p>
<p>
“It seems so sort of heartless,” she went on, “but
you know I’m planning only for the baby. There is
something sure about life insurance, and everything
else is so uncertain. Some of the stories Mr. Murray
told were very sad.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Murray was after business,” he said with a
laugh. “He told me long ago that he intended to insure
me, and it’s been a sort of friendly duel with us
ever since. But he has convinced me that he is right
in holding that every married man should carry life
insurance, and, aside from that, I would cheerfully
pay double premiums to relieve you of any cause for
worry. The insurance company is going to get the
best of me, though: I’ll live long enough to pay in
more than it will have to pay out.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course you will!” she exclaimed confidently.
“You’re so big and strong it seems foolish—except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
for the baby. That’s why we mustn’t take any
chances.”
</p>
<p>
So cheerful and confident was Wentworth that he
failed to notice the solemnity of the physician who
examined him the next day. The doctor began with
a joke, but he ended with a perplexed scowl.
</p>
<p>
“You certainly look as strong as a horse,” he said.
“But you’re not,” he added under his breath.
</p>
<p>
Then he made his report to Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Heart trouble,” he explained. “The man may live
twenty or thirty years or he may die to-morrow. My
personal opinion is that he will die within two years.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was startled and distressed. Wentworth
was his close personal friend, and to refuse his application
after he had striven so hard to get it seemed
heartless and cruel, especially as the refusal would
have to be accompanied by an explanation that would
be much like a death-warrant. Of course, he was in no
way responsible for the conditions, but it would seem
as if he were putting a limit on his friend’s life.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Positive,” replied the physician. “It is an impossible
risk.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you tell him?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“And I am to dine with him and his wife to-night,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
said Murray. “They will be sure to ask about the
policy.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was tempted to send word that he could
not come, but it was rather late for that. Besides, the
information would have to be given some time, so
what advantage could there be in procrastinating?
But it came to him as a shock. The news of actual
death would hardly have affected him more seriously,
for it seemed like a calamity with which he was personally
identified and for which he was largely responsible.
He knew that he was not, but he could not
banish the disquieting feeling that he was. He closed
his desk and walked slowly and thoughtfully to Wentworth’s
house, wishing, for once, that he had been
less successful in the “friendly duel.”
</p>
<p>
It was a long walk; he could easily have put in another
half-hour at the office had he chosen to take the
elevated; but he was in no humor for business and he
preferred to walk. It gave him additional time for
thought. He must decide when and how he would tell
Wentworth, and it is no easy task to tell a friend that
his hold upon life is too slight to make him a possible
insurance risk.
</p>
<p>
He would not do it to-night. It would be nothing
short of brutal so to spoil a pleasant evening. Wentworth
would have the knowledge soon enough, even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
with this respite, and he was entitled to as much of
joyousness and pleasure as could be given him.
</p>
<p>
Murray was noticeably dispirited. He tried to
be as jovial as usual, but he found himself looking
at his friend much as he would have looked at a condemned
man. There was sympathy and pity in his
face. He wondered when the hour of fate would arrive.
Might it not be that very evening? A moment
of temporary excitement might be fatal; anything in
the nature of a shock might mean the end. Indeed,
the very information he had to give might be the one
thing needed to snap the cord of life. If so, he would
feel that he had really killed his friend, and yet he
had no choice in the matter: he must refuse and he
must explain why he refused. If it had been his own
personal risk, he would have taken it cheerfully, but
even had he so desired, he could not take it for the
company in the face of the doctor’s report.
</p>
<p>
“What makes you so solemn?” asked Mrs. Wentworth.
“You look as if you had lost your best friend.”
</p>
<p>
“I feel as if I had,” Murray replied thoughtlessly,
and then he hastened to explain that some business
affairs disturbed and worried him.
</p>
<p>
“But your victory over Stanley ought to make you
cheerful,” she insisted. “Think of finally winning
after so long a fight!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“When shall I get the policy?” asked Wentworth.
</p>
<p>
“Policies are written at the home office,” answered
Murray evasively.
</p>
<p>
“But the insurance becomes effective when the application
is accepted and the first premium paid,
doesn’t it?” asked Wentworth.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now that I am at last converted to insurance
I am an enthusiast,” laughed Wentworth. “We won’t
waste any time at all. Get out your little check-book,
Helen, and give Murray a check for the first premium.
I’ll make it good to you to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe I could accept it now,” said Murray
hesitatingly. “There are certain forms, you
know—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, I’ll send you a check the first thing in
the morning,” interrupted Wentworth. “Perhaps it
isn’t just the thing to turn a little family dinner into
a business conference.”
</p>
<p>
“Better wait till you hear from me,” advised Murray,
and his face showed his distress. He wished to
avoid anything unpleasant at this time, but he was
being driven into a corner.
</p>
<p>
“Is—is anything wrong?” asked Mrs. Wentworth
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“There is an extraordinary amount of red tape to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
the insurance business,” explained Murray, and the
fact that he was very ill at ease did not escape the
notice of Wentworth. The latter said nothing, but
he lost his jovial air and he watched Murray as closely
as Murray had previously watched him. It did not
take him long to discover that Murray was abstracted
and uncomfortable; that he was a prey to painful
thoughts and kept track of the conversation only by
a strong effort of will.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wentworth, too, discovered that something
was wrong, and when the men retired to the library
to smoke she went to her own room in a very unhappy
frame of mind. She was sure that Murray had some
bad news for her husband, but it did not occur to her
that it concerned the insurance policy; it probably related
to some business venture, she thought, for she
knew that her husband had recently lost money and
had still more invested in a speculative enterprise.
Well, he would get the news from Murray, and she
would get it from him.
</p>
<p>
Murray did not remain long, and he went out very
quietly. Usually the two men laughed and joked at
parting, but there was something subdued about them
this time. As they paused for a moment at the door,
she heard her husband say, “That’s all right, old
man; it isn’t your fault.” Then, instead of coming to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
her, he put on his hat and left the house almost immediately
after Murray had gone.
</p>
<p>
It was late when he came back, but she was waiting
for him, and his face frightened her. He seemed to
have aged twenty years in a few hours; he was haggard
and pale and there was something of fear in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” she asked. “You look sick.”
</p>
<p>
“A little tired,” he answered with an attempt at
carelessness. “I’ll be all right to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Murray was troubled, too,” she persisted.
“What’s it all about?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, Murray has been unfortunate in a little business
affair,” he explained.
</p>
<p>
“And you’re concerned in it, too,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he admitted. “But it’s all right, so don’t
worry.”
</p>
<p>
More he refused to say, but later in the night,
waking suddenly, she heard him in the library, and,
stealing down stairs, found him pacing the floor in his
dressing-gown and slippers. He meekly went back to
bed when she gently chid him, but he was restless and
slept little.
</p>
<p>
The next morning he held her in his arms several
minutes before leaving for the office, and he knelt for
some time beside the baby’s crib. It was such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
leave-taking as might have been expected if he were going
on a long journey. And she knew that he was withholding
something from her.
</p>
<p>
At the office he shut himself up for nearly the whole
morning.
</p>
<p>
“It must be a mistake,” he kept muttering. “That
doctor is a fool. I’ll try another company.”
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon he put in an application and suggested
that, as a matter of business convenience, he
would like to be examined at once. Two days later he
was politely informed that the company, on the advice
of its physician, felt constrained to decline the
risk. But the man who is condemned to death does
not give up hope: he appeals to a higher court, holding
to the last that an error of law or of fact will be
discovered. Wentworth appealed his case, but the verdict
of the specialist he consulted was the same: he
might live many years, but he might die at any moment.
</p>
<p>
“I would advise you,” said the physician, “to give
up active business and to get your financial affairs in
the best possible shape. If you are to live, you must
take unusual precautions to avoid excitement and
worry.”
</p>
<p>
Avoid worry! What a mockery, when he was deprived
of the opportunities to make proper provision
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
for the little woman and the baby! He was well-to-do,
but only so long as he continued to live and make
money. Some investments he had, but they were
neither numerous nor large, and not of a character
that would be considered absolutely safe. He had invested
to make money rather than to save it in most
instances, so the amount that he had in really first-class
securities was comparatively trifling.
</p>
<p>
“If I continue in business, how long can I expect
to live, Doctor?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“It is problematical,” was the reply. “Frankly, I
don’t think I would give you more than two or three
years of active business life, with the possibility of
death at any moment during that time. Still, if you
are careful, you ought to last two years.”
</p>
<p>
Wentworth shuddered. He had told the physician
to speak frankly, but it was horrible to have the limit
of life set in this way.
</p>
<p>
“Retire from business,” the doctor added, “go to
some quiet place, and you <em>may</em> live as long as any
other.”
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t!” cried Wentworth. “I haven’t the
money, and I must provide for the little woman and
the baby. My God! how helpless they would be without me!”
</p>
<p>
Wentworth went from the doctor’s office to the safe-deposit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
vaults where he kept his securities. He was a
desperate man now—a man who had deliberately decided
to sacrifice his life for those he loved. He would
continue in business another year—two years, if
necessary and the Lord permitted—and he would
bend every energy to making provision for his little
family. It might—nay, probably would—kill him,
but what matter? To buy life at the expense of their
future would be supremely selfish. And he might succeed
before the fatal summons came: he might get his
affairs in such shape in a year that he could retire
with almost as good a chance of life as he had now—if
he could stand the strain so long. But in his heart
he felt he was pronouncing his own doom. He might
put the optimistic view of the situation in words, but
he did not believe the words. A great fear—a fear
that was almost a certainty—gripped hard at his
heart.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Hic jacet!</em>” he said to himself, as he went over the
securities and estimated the amount of available cash
he could command. He had speculated before and
had been reasonably successful in most instances; he
must speculate again, for in no other way could he
bring his resources up to the point desired within the
time limitations. The moment he reached this point
he would put everything in stocks or bonds that would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
be absolutely safe. Indeed, he would do this as fast
as he got a little ahead of the game.
</p>
<p>
Wentworth had speculated previously only with
money that he could afford to lose; but he was speculating
now with his entire surplus. It had been a
divertisement before; it was a business now. He had to
win—and he lost. No one could be more careful than
he, but his judgment was wrong. When he had given
the markets no particular attention he had taken an
occasional “flier” with success; when he made a study
of conditions and discussed the situation with friendly
authorities he found himself almost invariably in
error.
</p>
<p>
There was something pathetic and disquieting in
the affection and consideration he displayed for his
wife and child during this time. He endeavored to
conceal his own distress, but morning after morning
his wife clung to him and looked anxiously into his
face. He spoke cheeringly, but he grew daily more
haggard, and she knew he was concealing something.
Once she asked for news about the life insurance policy.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s all settled,” he replied, but he did not
tell her how it was settled.
</p>
<p>
Finally she went to see Murray. He had brought
the news that had made this great change in her husband,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
and he could tell her what was worrying him.
Murray had not called since that evening. While in
no sense responsible for it, he had been so closely identified
with this blow that had fallen on his friend that
he felt his presence, for a time at least, would be only
an unpleasant reminder.
</p>
<p>
“I must know this secret,” she told Murray with
earnest directness of speech. “It is killing Stanley.
He is worried and anxious, and he is working himself
to death in an effort to straighten out some complication.”
</p>
<p>
“He mustn’t do that!” exclaimed Murray quickly.
“Work and worry are the two things for him to
avoid.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?” demanded Mrs. Wentworth.
</p>
<p>
Murray hesitated. He knew why Wentworth had
kept this from his wife, but was it wise? The man
was deliberately walking to his grave. Ought not his
wife to be informed in order that she might take the
necessary steps to save him? It would be a breach of
confidence, but did not the circumstances justify it?
Wentworth was his friend, and he had a sincere regard
for Mrs. Wentworth. Surely he ought not to
stand idly by and witness a tragedy that he might
prevent.

<span class='caption'>“You—you didn’t insure him?” she said inquiringly</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>
“Mrs. Wentworth,” he said at last, “the thing that
is worrying Stanley is the fact that we had to decline
him as a risk.“
</p>
<p>
“You—you didn’t insure him?” she said inquiringly,
as if she did not quite comprehend.
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“He let me think you had.”
</p>
<p>
“Because he did not wish to distress you, and I assure
you, Mrs. Wentworth, I would not tell you this
myself, were it not for the fact that Stanley is doing
the most unwise thing possible.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very glad you did tell me,” she said quietly.
She was not an emotional woman, but the pallor of her
face and something of anxious fright in her eyes told
how deeply she felt. “What must I do?”
</p>
<p>
“Get him out of business and away from excitement,”
replied Murray promptly. “In a quiet place,
if he takes care of himself, he may live as long as any
of us.”
</p>
<p>
When Wentworth reached home that evening, the
little woman, always affectionate, greeted him with
unusual tenderness. She said nothing of her visit to
Murray, but later she brought up the subject of moving
to the country.
</p>
<p>
“I’m dreadfully worried about you, Stanley,” she
said. “You must take a vacation.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t,” he replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you must,” she insisted. “You’ve been working
too hard lately.”
</p>
<p>
“Next year,” he said, “I hope to get out of this city
turmoil and take you away to some quiet place, where
we can live for each other and the baby.”
</p>
<p>
She went over and knelt beside him, as he leaned
wearily back in his big arm-chair.
</p>
<p>
“Why not now?” she pleaded.
</p>
<p>
“My God! I can’t, Helen!” he cried. “I want to,
but I can’t! If you only knew—”
</p>
<p>
“I only know that you will break down, if you don’t
take a rest,” she interrupted hastily. It would only
add to his distress to learn that she knew his secret.
“Don’t you suppose I can see how you are overtaxing
your strength? We must go away for a time, anyway.”
</p>
<p>
“Little woman,” he said, putting an arm round her,
“it’s a question of finance, and you never could understand
that very well. When I get things in shape we
will go, but not yet. I have some investments to watch,
and,”—wearily,—“things have gone rather against
me lately. There are lots of things to be done before I
can take any extended vacation, and it is even a more
serious matter to retire permanently. My earning capacity
is about all we have to live on now.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought you had money invested,” she remarked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“I had,” he replied, “but it was not enough, and in
trying to make it enough I made some wrong guesses
on the market.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” she said cheerily. “We’ll make the
best of what’s left. We won’t need much if we get
away from this fearful life. It isn’t money that the
baby and I want, it’s you; and we don’t want you to
die for us, but to live for us.”
</p>
<p>
Wentworth gave his wife a quick glance, for this
was hitting very close to his secret; but he saw in her
only the very natural anxiety of a loving wife, who
knew that her husband was overtaxing his strength.
</p>
<p>
“You mean well,” he said, “but you don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wentworth was not a business woman, and she
knew little of her husband’s affairs, but she had a
feeling that this question of life insurance was all that
stood in the way of the precautions that he ought to
take. He could get something for his interest in the
business, if he retired, but not enough to make proper
provision for her. He could take up some quiet pursuit
and continue to make a little money as long as
he lived, but he could leave only the most trifling income.
And, in his efforts to improve matters, he had
only made them worse. She understood so much.
</p>
<p>
There was an undercurrent of sadness, but still
something beautiful, in the life that followed this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
conversation. All the little sympathetic attentions that
love can suggest, each gave to the other, while each
worried in secret, seeking only to make life a little
easier and more cheerful for the other.
</p>
<p>
But Mrs. Wentworth was becoming as desperate
as her husband, and even more unreasoning. Was
not her husband’s life worth all the money of all
the insurance companies? And were they not condemning
him to death by their action? It was
more than a risk that depended upon life; it was a
life that depended upon the risk. In a little time she
convinced herself that the insurance companies could
save him and would not, failing utterly to appreciate
the fact that, even with the greatest precautions,
the chances were against him; that there
was only a possibility that he might live longer
than a few years, the probability being quite the reverse.
</p>
<p>
Murray was shocked when she called to see him
again. The change in her husband was no greater
than the change in her. Was not the man she loved
committing suicide before her eyes? And was he not
doing this for love of her and the baby? Would not
such a condition of affairs make any woman desperate
and unreasoning?
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Murray,” she said, “if you are as good a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
friend to my husband as he has always been to you,
you will save his life.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do anything in my power, Mrs. Wentworth,”
replied Murray. “Nothing in life ever has so distressed
me as this.”
</p>
<p>
“Then give him the policy he wants.”
</p>
<p>
“Impossible! Why, the doctor—”
</p>
<p>
“You can fix it with the doctor; you know you can!
Or you can get another doctor to pass him! Oh, Mr.
Murray! I am not asking for money; I am asking for
life—for his life! It’s suicide—murder! I want to get
him away! I must get him away! But I can’t while
he fears for our future—the baby’s and mine! He
must provide for us, and he’s losing the little he had!
He can’t stand it a month longer! Give him the policy,
Mr. Murray, and I’ll swear to you never to present
it for payment! It’s only for him that I ask it! You
can give him life—give your friend life! Won’t you
do it?”
</p>
<p>
The tears were running down the little woman’s
cheeks, and Murray could not trust himself to speak
for a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Wentworth,” he said at last, “every cent I
have is at your husband’s disposal, if he needs it, but
what you ask is utterly impossible. The risk would be
refused at the home office, even if I passed it, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
fact that he has been refused by two other companies
would be reported there.”
</p>
<p>
In the case of another, Murray would have said
more, but he knew that Mrs. Wentworth was quite beside
herself and did not really appreciate that she was
asking him to be dishonest with the company that employed
him.
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t touch a cent of the money of such a
friend!” she exclaimed with sudden anger. “He’s not
a beggar, and neither am I! All I seek for him is the
tranquility that means life; all I ask is the removal
of the anxiety that means death. And this little you
will not do for a friend!” She was beside herself with
desperation.
</p>
<p>
It was bitter, it was harsh, it was unjustifiable, but
Murray had forgiven her before she had ceased speaking.
The depth of her feeling and the excitement
under which she was laboring were sufficient to excuse
her. But he felt as if he really were condemning his
friend to death. Yet what could he do? He would
cheerfully give a thousand dollars out of his own
pocket to make things easier for the two suffering
ones, but it was not a matter of ready cash. Wentworth
had enough of that.
</p>
<p>
In the deepest distress Murray was pacing back and
forth when the door opened and Wentworth himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
staggered in. Murray was at his side in a moment and
guided him to a chair.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, old man?”
</p>
<p>
“Lost everything,” Wentworth gasped. “Tried to
protect—margined to limit—all gone!”
</p>
<p>
“But your interest in the business?”
</p>
<p>
“Sold it—to protect deal.” He seemed almost at the
point of collapse, but he rallied for a moment. “Insurance!”
he cried. “I must have it! Damn the company!
You must put it through for me! You hear, Murray!”
The man was almost crazy, and he spoke fiercely.
“You’ve got to do it—for humanity’s sake! Can’t
leave them penniless!”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll talk about it to-morrow,” said Murray
soothingly.
</p>
<p>
“You lie, Murray!” the excited man cried. “You
won’t do it at all; you’ll see them starve first, you—you
dog! I’ll kill you, if you don’t—”
</p>
<p>
Wentworth had risen in frenzied fury, as he pictured
the future of his loved ones; he swayed for an
instant, and Murray caught him as he fell. He was
dead before Murray could get him back into the chair.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Murray did all that anyone could do for the bereaved
woman, and more than any one else would
have done, for the next day he sent her this letter:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Dear Mrs. Wentworth: After a conference with our
physician we decided that a small risk on Mr. Wentworth
would be justified, and the matter was closed up
yesterday afternoon just previous to his death. As a
result of my close personal relations with him, I know
that he left his affairs in rather a complicated condition,
so, as it will take a little time to file the necessary
proofs and get the money from the company, I am
taking the liberty of sending you my personal check
for the amount of the policy, one thousand dollars,
and I hope that you will not hesitate to call on me for
any service that is in my power to render. With the
deepest sympathy, I am,
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>Very sincerely yours,</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'><span class='sc'>David Murray</span>.</p>
<p>
“A lie,” he muttered, referring to the insurance
item; “a cold, deliberate lie, but I feel better for telling
it.”

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span><a name='c4' id='c4'></a>AN INCIDENTAL SPECULATION</h2>
<p>
Just when the Interurban Traction Company
thought the successful culmination of its plans in sight
it woke up to the fact that there had been a miscalculation
or an oversight somewhere. It had the absolute
or prospective control of all the principal lines
embraced in its elaborate scheme of connecting various
towns and cities by trolley, which means that it had
bought a good deal of the necessary stock and had
options on most of the rest; but there was one insignificant
little road that it had left to the last. This
road had been a losing venture from its inception, and
its stock was quoted far below par, with no buyers.
As a matter of business policy, the more successful
roads should be secured first, for the moment the secret
was out their stocks would soar. They represented the
larger investments, and their stock-holders could hold
on, if they saw the advisability of it, without making
any financial sacrifice; they were in a position to “hold
up” the new company in the most approved modern
style. But the Bington road was weak and unprofitable,
valuable only as a connecting link in the chain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Colonel Babington, who was at
the head of the new venture, “we’re sure to be held up
somewhere on the line, and these people can hold us up
for less than any of the others. They haven’t much as
a basis for a hold-up, and they can’t afford to go on
losing money. We can buy their road cheap the first
thing, but the discovery of the purchase will give our
plans away and add a million dollars to the cost of
carrying them out. Any fool would know that we were
not buying that road for itself alone. Why, the mere
rumor that negotiations were opened would add fifty
or a hundred per cent. to the value of the other stocks
we want. We can’t afford even to wink at that road
until we get control of the others.”
</p>
<p>
So they went about their work very secretly, hoping
so to conceal their design that they would be able to
get the last link at the bed-rock price; but, when the
time came, entirely unexpected difficulties were encountered.
The stock-holders might have been tractable
enough, but the stock-holders themselves had been
fooled.
</p>
<p>
“Why, there was a young fellow here last week,”
they explained, “and he got a sixty-day option on
enough stock to control the road.”
</p>
<p>
“Who was he?” asked the startled Colonel Babington.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“His name is Horace Lake,” they told him.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to look Horace up,” remarked the colonel
thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Horace was congratulating himself on
having done a good stroke of business, and further
amusing himself by figuring his possible profit.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been looking for just such a chance as this,”
he told Dave Murray, the insurance man.
</p>
<p>
“Have you got the money to carry it through?”
asked the practical Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I had enough to put up a small forfeit to bind the
option and convince them that I mean business, and I
don’t need any more,” returned Lake.
</p>
<p>
“Once in a great while,” said Murray, “a man
makes a good lot of money on a bluff, but even then
he usually has some backing. It takes money to make
money, as a general rule. You will find that most successful
men, even those who are noted for their nervy
financiering, got the basis of their fortunes by hard
work and rigid economy. Wind may be helpful, but it
makes a poor foundation.”
</p>
<p>
“This is one of the times when it is about all that is
necessary,” laughed Lake. “I got a little inside information
about the Interurban Traction Company’s
plans in time to secure an option on one link in its
chain of roads, and it has simply got to do business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
with me before it can make its line complete. For
twenty thousand dollars, paid any time within sixty
days, I can control the blooming little line, and the
option to buy at that price is going to cost the traction
company just twenty-five thousand dollars, which
will be clear profit for me.”
</p>
<p>
“It sounds nice,” admitted Murray, “but, if I were
in your place, I’d feel a good deal better if I had the
money to make good. If they don’t buy, you lose your
forfeit, which represents every cent you could scrape
up.”
</p>
<p>
“They will buy,” asserted Lake confidently.
</p>
<p>
“They may think it cheaper to parallel your line,”
suggested Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not worrying,” returned Lake confidently.
“I’m just waiting for them to come and see me, and
they’ll come.”
</p>
<p>
Lake’s prophecy proved correct. They came—at
least Colonel Babington came, he being the active
manager of the company’s affairs. But Colonel Babington
first took the precaution to learn all he could
of Horace Lake’s financial standing and resources.
This convinced him that it was what he termed a
“hold-up,” but, even so, it was better to pay a reasonable
bonus than to have a fight.
</p>
<p>
“We will give you,” said Colonel Babington, “a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
thousand dollars for your option on the majority stock
of the Bington road.”
</p>
<p>
“The price,” replied Lake, “is twenty-five thousand
dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear young man,” exclaimed the colonel, when
he had recovered his breath, “you ought to see a
specialist in mental disorders. You are clearly not
right in your mind.”
</p>
<p>
“The price,” repeated Lake, “is twenty-five thousand
dollars now, and, if I am put to any trouble or
annoyance in the matter, the price will go up.”
</p>
<p>
“A bluff,” said the colonel, “is of use only when the
opposing party does not know it is a bluff. We happen
to know it. You haven’t the money to buy that
road, and you can’t get it.”
</p>
<p>
“You speak with extraordinary certainty,” returned
Lake with dignified sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
“The road,” asserted the colonel, “is valuable only
to us, and we can parallel it, if necessary. No conservative
capitalist is going to advance you the money
to buy it in the face of such a risk as that, so we have
only to wait until your option expires to get it from
the men who now own it, and I may add that we have
taken a second option at a slightly higher price.
Therefore, your only chance to get out of the deal
with a profit is to let us acquire the road under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
first option at something less than the second option
price. To avoid any unnecessary delay, we might be
willing to pay you a bonus of two thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“The price,” said Lake, “is now twenty-six thousand.”
</p>
<p>
“Sixty days—less than fifty now, as a matter of
fact—is not such a long time,” remarked the colonel.
“We will wait.”
</p>
<p>
Lake told Murray later that he “had them in a corner,”
but Murray was inclined to be doubtful; fighting
real money with wind, he said, was always a risky
undertaking, and the Interurban Traction Company
had plenty of real money. Lake, however, being in the
“bluffing” line himself, was inclined to think all others
were doing business on the same basis, and he confidently
expected the colonel to return in a few days.
But the colonel came not.
</p>
<p>
Then Lake made another trip to Bington, to look
the ground over, and he was disturbed to find that the
colonel had been sounding the people on a proposition
to put a line through the town on another street.
This was only a tentative plan, to be adopted in case
of failure to get the existing line, but it showed that
the company was not disposed to be held up without a
fight. Fortunately, the people did not take kindly to
the idea. The principal shops were on the line of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
trolley now, and the proprietors did not wish to have
travel diverted to another street.
</p>
<p>
Lake devoted several days to missionary work in
Bington, pointing out the great depreciation of property
that would follow such a move, and he finally left
with a feeling that the company would have an extremely
difficult time getting the necessary legislation
from the town officials. Still, he was not entirely at
ease, for officials are sometimes “induced” to act contrary
to the wishes of the people they are supposed to
represent. But he believed he had made the situation
such that Babington would come back to him. Surely,
it would be cheaper to deal with him than to buy an
entire town board.
</p>
<p>
Thirty of the sixty days slipped away, and Lake
grew really anxious. The Interurban Traction Company
could not be a success without a connecting link
between the two main stretches of its line, and Lake
had not believed that it would dare to proceed with its
plans until this was assured. Consequently, he had expected
all work to stop, pending negotiations with
him. But work did not stop. There were two or three
trifling gaps at other places, and the company was
laying the rails to bridge them, in addition to improving
the road-beds of the lines it had bought. It even
began to build a half-mile of track to reach one terminus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
of his little road. Clearly, there was no anticipation
of trouble in ultimately beating him.
</p>
<p>
“It’s my lack of money,” he soliloquized. “I’ve got
the basis of a good thing, if I only had the money to
make it good, but I haven’t, and they know it. Murray
was right.”
</p>
<p>
His thoughts being thus turned to Murray, he went
to see him, in the faint hope that he might interest him
in the plan. Murray had money to invest. But Murray
deemed the risk too great in this instance.
</p>
<p>
“They can beat you,” said Murray. “They have
unlimited resources, and they’ll certainly get through
Bington on another street, if you persist in making
your terms too stiff. Very likely, they would have
given you three thousand or possibly even five thousand
for your option when they first came to you, and
they may do it now.”
</p>
<p>
“I tell you, it’s a good thing,” insisted Lake.
</p>
<p>
“If it’s really as good a thing as you think it is,”
said Murray, “you will have no difficulty in getting
somebody with money to take it off your hands at a
good margin of profit to you, but I can’t see it.”
</p>
<p>
In this emergency, Lake recalled a man of considerable
wealth who had known him as a boy and had
taken an interest in him. It was humiliating not to be
able to put the scheme through himself, after all his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
planning and confident talk, but it was better to turn
it over to some one else than to fail entirely. So he
went to see Andrew Belden.
</p>
<p>
“There is a remote chance of success,” declared
Belden, “but I would not care to risk twenty thousand
on it.”
</p>
<p>
“The company can’t get through Bington, except
on that franchise,” insisted Lake.
</p>
<p>
“That may be so,” admitted Belden, “but I have
learned not to be too confident in forecasting the action
of public officials and corporations. The company
could make a strong point by threatening to cut out
Bington entirely and carry its line to one side of it.”
</p>
<p>
“That would make a loop in their road that would
be costly in building and in the delays it would occasion,”
argued Lake. “They can’t make any circuits,
if they are to do the business.”
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless,” returned Belden, “their actions
show that they are very sure of their ground.”
</p>
<p>
“Simply because I haven’t the ready cash,” said
Lake bitterly. “Will you loan it to me, Mr. Belden?
If you won’t go into the deal yourself, will you loan
me the money to put it through? I’ll give you the
stock as security, and I think you know me well enough
to know that I’ll repay every cent of it as rapidly as
possible.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
“My dear Horace,” exclaimed Belden with frank
friendliness, “I haven’t the least doubt of your integrity,
but I have very serious doubts of your ability
to repay any such sum, and it is more than I care to
lose. You never have had a thousand dollars at one
time in your life, and I may say, without intending to
be unkind, that it isn’t likely you ever will. As for the
security, its value depends entirely on the success of
your plans: if you fail, it won’t be worth ten cents.
Now, if you had any real security, upon which I could
realize in case anything happened to you, I would
cheerfully let you have the money for as long a time
as you wish. Although your plan does not appeal to
me, I am sincerely anxious to be of assistance to you
as far as possible, but I can’t make you a gift of
twenty thousand dollars. Convince me that it will be
repaid ultimately—no matter in how long a time—and
I will let you have it.”
</p>
<p>
Lake departed, discouraged. He had no security of
any sort to offer, and had only asked for the loan as a
desperate last resort, without the slightest expectation
that he would get it. The company, he decided, had
beaten him, just because no one else was clear-headed
enough to see the opportunity, and he might as well
get what little profit he could while there was still time.
With this object in view, he went to see the colonel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have decided,” he said, “to let you have the road
for a bonus of five thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“That is very kind of you,” returned the colonel,
“but we can get it cheaper. You see,” he explained,
with the disagreeable frankness of one who thinks he
holds the winning hand, “the minority stock-holders
were a little disgruntled when they learned of your
deal—thought they had been left out in the cold—and
they were ready to make very favorable terms with us.
As we have a second option on the majority stock, at
a somewhat higher figure, we have only to wait until
your option expires and then take the little we need
to give us control.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll let you have my option for the two thousand
you offered a month ago,” said Lake in desperation.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not worth that to us now.”
</p>
<p>
“One thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, frankly, Mr. Lake,” said the colonel still
pleasantly, “we men of some experience and standing
in the business world don’t like to have half-baked
financiers interfering with our plans, and we aim to
discourage them as effectually as possible whenever
possible.” Then, with a sudden change of tone: “We
won’t give you a damn cent for your option. You
were too greedy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of course, you men of money and high finance are
not greedy at all,” retorted Lake sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
Lake was too depressed to see it at the moment, but
later it began to dawn on him that the colonel, usually
astute, had made a grievous mistake. In his anxiety
to impress upon the young man the futility of his
avaricious schemes, in the face of such wise and resourceful
opposition, he had mentioned the fact that
the minority stock had been brought within their
reach. Had they already bought it, or had they only
secured options on it? If already purchased, the purchase
price would prove a dead loss, unless they were
able to get enough more to secure control. To parallel
the road would be to kill a company in which they
were financially interested, in addition to incurring
the considerable expense necessary for a new connecting
link.
</p>
<p>
Lake went to Bington that afternoon, and returned
the following morning. The game was his, if he could
raise the money; they had bought most of the minority
stock outright, being unable to get options on it.
He was sure of victory now, if he could raise the
money. He no longer wished to turn the deal over to
any one else on any terms: he wished to carry it to
the conclusion himself. But the money, the money!
</p>
<p>
He tried Belden again, but Belden still considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
the security utterly inadequate for a loan of twenty
thousand dollars. In truth, although Belden considered
the outlook a little more promising now, he
doubted the young man’s ability to handle such a deal,
and it would take very little to upset all calculations.
The company’s investment was not sufficient to prevent
the abandonment of the road in some very possible
circumstances, although it was ample evidence of
a present plan to use it. Murray took the same view of
the situation.
</p>
<p>
“It begins to look like a good speculation,” said
Murray, “but I haven’t the money to invest in it, and
I never was much of a speculator, anyway. I have
discovered that, as a general thing, when the possible
profit begins to climb very much over the legal rate
of interest, the probability of loss increases with it.
However, if you want to take the risk, that’s your
affair, provided you have the money.”
</p>
<p>
“But I haven’t,” complained Lake; “that’s the
trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“Too bad you’re not carrying enough insurance to
be of some use,” remarked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“What good would that do?” asked Lake.
</p>
<p>
“Why, then you’d only have to convince your wife
that you have a safe investment, and it’s always easier
to convince your wife than it is to convince some coldblooded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
capitalist. Insurance ranks high as security,
but of course the beneficiary has to consent to its use.”
</p>
<p>
“I never had thought of insurance as a factor in
financiering,” said Lake. “I had regarded it more as a
family matter.”
</p>
<p>
“It plays an important part in the business world,”
explained Murray, “and it might even play a part
in speculation. There is partnership insurance, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“I may have heard of it, but I never gave it any
consideration.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not a speculation, but a business precaution,”
said Murray. “The partners are insured in favor of
the firm. If one of them dies, it gives the firm the
ready cash to buy his interest from the widow, without
infringing on the business capital. Partnership
insurance may sometimes prevent a failure; it may
prevent several. Many interests may depend temporarily
upon the operation of one man, and his sudden
death might spell ruin for a number of people,
unless they were protected by insurance. The policy
is playing a more important part in the business world
every day. There are lots of strange things that can
be done when you fully understand it.”
</p>
<p>
“But that doesn’t help me,” asserted Lake impatiently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“No,” returned Murray, “I don’t see how insurance
could help you just now, unless you were to die. A
policy won’t be accepted as security for a sum in excess
of the premiums paid, for you might default.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not the kind of man who dies to win,” said
Lake rather sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” replied Murray. “I was merely
considering the financial possibilities of policies.” All
insurance questions being of absorbing interest to
Murray, he straightway forgot all about Lake’s predicament,
and busied his mind with his own speculations.
“There is so much that can be done with insurance,”
he went on, “but I guess it’s just as well the
public doesn’t know it all. Do you remember the case
of Rankin, the banker who committed suicide?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Rankin couldn’t have done anything with
our company, because the element of premeditation is
assumed if death by suicide occurs within two years
from the time the policy is issued. After that the
manner of death cuts no figure, for the courts have
held that an insurance company takes a risk on the
mind as well as the body of a policy-holder, and, anyway,
competition has cut out the old suicide restrictions.
But there are companies that issue policies incontestable
after the date of issue. Suppose Rankin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
when he found his affairs in such shape that he no
longer dared to face the world, had gone to one or
more of these companies. A hundred thousand dollars—very
likely less—would have protected his bank
and provided for his family. He had already decided
to kill himself, for his operations had been such that
he could not hope to escape the penitentiary when discovery
came, but he was ostensibly still a prosperous
man. Many men of his standing insure themselves for
extraordinarily large sums, to protect legitimately
their business interests as well as their families.
</p>
<p>
“Not so very long ago we issued a paid-up policy
for fifty thousand dollars on the life of one man,
who died within three years, and we thought nothing
of it. He was taking a risk on his own life
then, for he thought he was going to live long
enough to make a paid-up policy cheaper than the
aggregate of annual payments, whereas there would
have been a saving to his estate of a good many
thousands of dollars if he had followed the other
plan. However, that has nothing to do with this
case; I mention it only to show that a man of Rankin’s
apparent standing could have got insurance to
any amount without creating comment. And, with
an incontestable-after-date-of-issue policy, he could
have protected his business associates and his family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
by the very culmination of his overwhelming
disgrace. Why, a defaulter could use part of his
stolen money in this way to provide for his family
when the moment of discovery and death shall come,
or a dishonest business man, facing ruin, could use his
creditors’ money to make such provision, for insurance
money is something sacred, that can not be reached
like the rest of an estate. Oh, there are great dramatic
possibilities in this business, Lake—tragedies and
comedies and dramas of which the public knows nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“How does that help me?” demanded Lake gloomily,
and the question brought Murray back to the
realities of the moment.
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t help you,” Murray replied, “but it’s an
intensely interesting subject to one who gives it a little
time and thought.”
</p>
<p>
Yet it did help Lake, although not at that moment.
It was a new field, and Lake liked to explore new
fields. A novelty that taxed his ingenuity appealed to
him especially. True, he had enough to occupy his
mind without entering upon idle speculation, but,
when every other avenue to success seemed closed, his
thoughts would revert to insurance.
</p>
<p>
“If it holds out such opportunities for others, why
not for me?” he asked. “If others have entirely overlooked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
the possibilities, why may not I be doing the
same thing?”
</p>
<p>
He met the colonel on the street occasionally, and
the way the colonel smiled at him was maddening.
There could be no doubt that the colonel considered
the game won, but he was not a man to take chances:
he had Lake watched, and the latter’s every move was
reported to him. Even when Lake made another trip
to Bington and endeavored to arrange a shrewd deal
with some of the majority stock-holders, the colonel
promptly heard of it.
</p>
<p>
“Accept my notes in payment for the stock,” Lake
urged on that occasion, “and I’ll let you in on the
profits of the deal. The traction company has got to
get this road, but you can’t hold it up for a big price,
because you were foolish enough to give it a second
option. I can do it, however. Let me have the stock,
and you can divide up among yourselves half of all I
get in excess of the option price. My notes will be
paid, and you will have a bonus of twelve or fifteen
thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
But the stock-holders were conservative and cautious
men, and the very fact that Lake could not
command the money that he needed made them suspicious.
As matters stood, they were sure of getting
out of a losing venture with a small profit—at least,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
so it seemed to them—and they preferred that to the
risk of losing everything in an effort to secure a larger
profit. Furthermore, they were now on the side of the
colonel, for his option was at a larger price. And the
colonel was very confident—so confident that work was
being rushed on details that would prove valueless
without the Bington road. This was what made Lake
desperately angry; it was humiliating to be treated as
a helpless weakling.
</p>
<p>
As valuable time passed, his mind reverted again to
the insurance field. His opportunity—the opportunity
of a lifetime—was almost lost. The colonel, wishing to
lose no time, had arranged for a meeting with certain
of the majority stock-holders the day the first option
expired. The option expired at noon, and the colonel
would be ready to take over what stock he needed at
one minute after the noon hour. This would not be
very much, in view of the minority stock he already
held, but the sanguine stock-holders did not know this:
they expected him to take all of it.
</p>
<p>
“Some of them are going to find they’re tricked,
just as I am,” Lake grumbled. “If I could only convince
Belden of the ultimate absolute security of a
loan! He wants to help me; he’s ready to be convinced;
but—”
</p>
<p>
People passing saw this moody, depressed young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
man stop short in the street and his eye light with
sudden hope.
</p>
<p>
“By thunder!” he exclaimed. “Of course, I can
protect him against unforeseen disaster, if he has confidence
in my integrity!”
</p>
<p>
He was almost jubilant when he entered Belden’s
office.
</p>
<p>
“Got the money?” asked Belden.
</p>
<p>
“No; but I know how to get it,” replied Lake.
“You believe in my honesty, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Implicitly.”
</p>
<p>
“You merely doubt my ability?”
</p>
<p>
“Your financial ability,” explained Belden. “You
will do what you agree to do—if you can. I have no
earthly doubt of your willingness, even anxiety, to repay
every obligation you may incur, but, added to
other risks, there is the possibility of accident.”
</p>
<p>
“If I eliminate that?”
</p>
<p>
“You may have the money.”
</p>
<p>
“On long time?”
</p>
<p>
“The time and the terms are immaterial.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll come for it later,” announced Lake, and he
departed, leaving Belden puzzled and curious.
</p>
<p>
Once outside, Lake stopped to do a little mental
figuring before taking up the other details of his plan.
</p>
<p>
“I advanced five hundred to bind the option,” he reflected.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
“That leaves nineteen thousand five hundred
necessary to put the deal through. Twenty thousand
from Belden will give me just the margin I need.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was as much puzzled and surprised by the
change in the man as Belden had been, and Murray,
like Belden, was anxious to help him in any reasonably
safe way.
</p>
<p>
“Am I good for five hundred for thirty days, if I
give you my positive assurance that I know exactly
how I am going to pay it in that time?” asked Lake.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” replied Murray. “On short-time
figuring you’re a pretty safe man.”
</p>
<p>
“Draw me a check for it, and I’ll give you my
thirty-day note,” said Lake, “and my verbal assurance
that it’s a cinch.”
</p>
<p>
Murray noted the confidence of Lake’s tone and
manner, and drew the check.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with it?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Pay a life insurance premium,” laughed Lake.
“Give me an application blank and round up a medical
examiner. I want a twenty-year endowment policy
for twenty thousand dollars, and I want it put
through like a limited express that’s trying to make
up time.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you know what you’re doing,” said
Murray doubtfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
“You bet I do!” Lake spoke confidently.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very well,” remarked Murray. “I don’t see
how I can refuse business for the company, even if I
stand to lose.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t lose,” declared Lake with joyous enthusiasm.
“I’m going to show you a new trick in the
line of insurance financiering.”
</p>
<p>
After that, Lake haunted Murray’s office, and grew
daily more anxious. He was a good risk, but certain
formalities were necessary, and these took time, although
Murray did his utmost to shorten the routine.
Lake’s nervousness increased; he had Murray telegraph
the home office; he grew haggard, for he had
not counted on this delay; but finally, in the moment
of almost utter despair, the policy was delivered to
him. An hour later he was in Belden’s office.
</p>
<p>
“I want twenty thousand at four per cent., payable
at the rate of one thousand a year, with interest!” he
cried. “I’ll pay it, to a certainty, within sixty days,
but I’m trying to make it look more reasonable, to
satisfy you. You believe I can pay one thousand a
year, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“If you live.”
</p>
<p>
“If I don’t,” exclaimed Lake, “there is insurance
for twenty thousand in my wife’s favor, and duly assigned
to you,” and he banged the policy down on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
desk in front of the astonished Belden. “You can
trust me to take care of the premiums, can’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Your integrity I never doubted,” replied Belden,
“and that obligation should be within your means.”
</p>
<p>
“My rule of life shall be: the premiums first, the
payments on the note next,” declared Lake. “If I fall
behind in the latter, the security will still be good. I
only ask that anything in excess of what may be due
you, in case of my death, shall go to my wife, and she,
of course, becomes the sole beneficiary the moment you
are paid. But, for the love of heaven, hurry!”
</p>
<p>
Instead of hurrying, Belden leaned back in his
chair and looked at the young man with bewildered
admiration.
</p>
<p>
“Such ingenuity,” he said at last, “ought not to go
unrewarded. As a strict business proposition, your
plan would hardly find favor with a conservative
banker, but, as a matter of friendship and confidence—”
He reached for his check-book. “Such a
head as yours is worth a risk,” he added a moment
later.
</p>
<p>
Lake reached the office of the Bington road at
11:30 on the day his option expired. The colonel was
already there, waiting. So were some of the majority
stock-holders. The colonel was confident and unusually
loquacious.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now that the matter is practically settled,” he remarked
with the cheerful frankness of a man who has
won, “I may admit that the young man had us up a
tree. He succeeded in putting the other route
through Bington practically beyond our reach, and
forced us to take the risk of doing business with the
minority stock-holders at a possible dead loss. But we
knew he didn’t have the money, so we went ahead with
our plans and our work without delay. A little ready
cash—”
</p>
<p>
It was then that Lake entered and deposited a small
satchel on the long table.
</p>
<p>
“I will take the stock under my option,” he announced
briefly to such of the majority stock-holders
as were present. “I think I have got all I need, with
the exception of what is represented by you gentlemen.
It has been a pretty busy morning for me.” He
emptied the stock certificates already acquired and
some bundles of bank-notes on the table. “Colonel,”
he said with a joyous and triumphant laugh, “you’d
better sit up and begin to take notice.”
</p>
<p>
The colonel’s attitude and air of easy confidence already
had changed, and his look of amazement and
dismay was almost laughable.
</p>
<p>
“Quick, gentlemen,” cautioned Lake, with a glance
at the clock. “I’ve tendered the money in time, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
I’ll feel a little more comfortable when I have the rest
of the needed stock.”
</p>
<p>
Like one in a dream the colonel leaned over the
table and watched the transaction.
</p>
<p>
“Do—do you want to sell some of that stock?” he
asked at last.
</p>
<p>
“No,” replied Lake; “I don’t want to sell some of
it; I want to sell all of it.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t need all of it,” said the colonel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” returned Lake
magnanimously. “I’ll sell you all or any part of it
for fifty thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“On the basis of fifty thousand for your entire holdings?”
asked the colonel.
</p>
<p>
“No; at the set price of fifty thousand for whatever
you take.”
</p>
<p>
“Too much,” said the colonel.
</p>
<p>
“As you please,” said Lake carelessly. “The price
of the control of the Bington road goes up one thousand
dollars a day. It’s dirt cheap at fifty thousand
now, but, of course, if you don’t need it, Colonel, the
bargain price doesn’t interest you.”
</p>
<p>
The colonel did need it; in fact, the company, in its
sublime confidence, had put itself in a position where
failure to get it meant a considerable loss.
</p>
<p>
“On second thought,” remarked Lake, “I’ll have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
to add a thousand to compensate me for the indignity
of being called a half-baked financier. Do you remember
that, Colonel?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll take it,” said the colonel resignedly. Then
he added reflectively: “You’ve made a pretty good
thing out of this, Lake.”
</p>
<p>
“Fair, fair,” replied Lake. “After I’ve repaid the
twenty thousand five hundred that I borrowed, I’ll
have thirty thousand five hundred left, not to mention
an insurance policy for twenty thousand in favor of
my wife, with the first premium paid. You ought to
study the insurance question, Colonel. There are wonderful
financial possibilities in it, and some day, perhaps,
you will wake up to the fact that insurance beat
you in this deal.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span><a name='c5' id='c5'></a>AN INCIDENTAL FAVOR</h2>
<p>
On the same day two women called to see Dave
Murray in regard to the same matter, and that was
the beginning of the trouble.
</p>
<p>
The first was Mrs. Albert Vincent. The obituary
columns of the morning papers had given a few lines
to the death of Albert Vincent, but Murray had not
expected to hear from his widow so promptly, and she
was a little too businesslike to meet his idea as to the
proprieties of the occasion. In fact, there was no indication
of either outward mourning or inward grief.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps you will recall,” she said, without the
slightest trace of emotion, “that I wrote to you some
time ago to ask if the premiums on my husband’s insurance
had been fully paid.”
</p>
<p>
“I recall it,” replied Murray.
</p>
<p>
“And you answered that they had been paid.”
</p>
<p>
“I recall that also,” said Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Well, he died last night,” explained the widow,
“and I would like to know when I can get the insurance
money.”
</p>
<p>
Murray looked at her in amazement. He had had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
to deal with many people whom necessity made importunate,
but never before had he met such cold-bloodedness
as this woman displayed in tone and manner.
Apparently, it was no more to her than a business
investment, upon which she was now about to realize.
</p>
<p>
“There are certain formalities necessary,” he said,
“but there will be little delay after proper proof of
death has been filed. You will, of course, have the attending
physician—”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know who he is,” interrupted the woman.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know who he is!” repeated Murray in
astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“No. But I will find out and see him at once. It is
important that there shall be as little delay as possible.”
</p>
<p>
Previous experiences made Murray quick at jumping
to conclusions in such cases, and he now thought
he had the explanation of this unusually prompt call.
The woman was stylishly dressed, but that was no
proof that she had the ready cash essential at such a
time.
</p>
<p>
“I think I understand,” said Murray delicately.
“You can not meet the expenses incident to—”
</p>
<p>
“I have nothing to do with any expenses,” the
woman again interrupted coldly. “<em>She</em> looked after
him in life, and she can look after him now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“She!” exclaimed Murray. “Who?”
</p>
<p>
“The nurse,” replied the woman scornfully. “But
she can’t have the insurance—not a cent of it. And
that’s what she has been after.”
</p>
<p>
“Let me understand this,” said Murray thoughtfully.
“You and your husband have not been living
together?”
</p>
<p>
“Not for five years.”
</p>
<p>
“And this other woman?”
</p>
<p>
“She was an old flame, and she went to him when
he became ill.”
</p>
<p>
“Did he send for you?”
</p>
<p>
“No. He knew better than to do that. But the insurance
is in my name, and I’m going to have it—all
of it. That’s my right, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Murray slowly; “I’m sorry to say
that is your absolute right.” The supreme selfishness
and heartlessness of the woman were revolting to
Murray. “The policy names you as beneficiary, and
when it is presented, with proof of death, the money
will have to be paid to you.”
</p>
<p>
“How am I to get the policy?” asked the woman.
“He had it put away somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“That is a matter upon which I can not undertake
to advise you,” replied Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” declared the woman defiantly, for Murray’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
words and expression showed his disapprobation,
“I want to serve notice on you that not one cent of the
money is to be paid to any one else. It would be just
like that nurse to try to get it.”
</p>
<p>
“You shall have every cent to which you are entitled,”
replied Murray with frigid courtesy, “but
nothing is to be gained by further discussion.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose,” exclaimed the woman with sharp resentfulness,
“that your sympathies are with that
shameless nurse.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” returned Murray quietly. “I’m not
at all sure that your husband was not the one who was
most entitled to sympathy.”
</p>
<p>
It was unlike Murray to speak thus brutally, but
the woman irritated him. Many were the examples
of selfishness that had come to his notice, but this
seemed to him a little worse than any of the others.
That she had been living apart from her husband
might be due to no fault of hers, but she impressed
him as being a vain, vindictive, mercenary woman,
with no thought above the rather gaudy clothes she
wore—just the kind to demand everything and give
nothing. Certainly her actions showed that she lacked
all the finer sensibilities that one naturally associates
with true women. No matter what might lie back of it
all, common decency should have prevented her from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
making such a display of her own small soul at such a
time. At least, so Murray thought.
</p>
<p>
“She is the kind of woman who marries a man’s
bank account,” he mused, “and considers the inability
to supply her with all the money she wants as the
first evidence of incompatibility of temper. Some
women think they want a husband when they really
only want an accommodating banker.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was still musing in this strain when the
second woman called. Unlike the first, this woman
gave some evidence of grief and mourning: her eyes
showed that she had been weeping, and her attire, although
not the regulation mourning, was as near to it
as a scanty wardrobe would permit on short notice.
But she was self-possessed, and spoke with patient resignation.
</p>
<p>
“Necessity,” she explained, “has compelled me to
come to see you at this time about Albert Vincent’s life
insurance policy.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” exclaimed Murray thoughtlessly, “you are
the nurse!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” she replied quietly, after one startled look,
“I am the nurse. I infer that Mrs. Vincent has been
here.”
</p>
<p>
“She has just left,” said Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Her attentions,” said the nurse bitterly, “have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
been confined to an effort to get prompt news of her
husband’s death.”
</p>
<p>
Murray knew instinctively that a little drama of life
was opening before him, but his duty was clear.
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless,” he said, “the policy is in her name.”
</p>
<p>
“In her name!” cried the nurse. “Why, he told
me—” Then she stopped short. She would not betray
his perfidy, even if he had been false to her.
</p>
<p>
“What did he tell you?” asked Murray kindly.
</p>
<p>
“No matter,” answered the nurse. “I—I only
wanted enough to defray the—the necessary expenses.
That’s why I came. There isn’t a cent—not a cent.
Even the little money I had has been used, and there
are debts—But she’ll pay, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was deeply distressed. Mrs. Albert Vincent
was so bitter—possibly with justification, although
he did not like to believe it—that she would do
nothing; her feeling was simply one of deep resentment
that even death could not allay. But he hesitated
to say so.
</p>
<p>
“Let me understand this matter a little better,” he
said at last. “I am sincerely anxious to be of any assistance
possible, but the circumstances are unusual.”
</p>
<p>
The nurse fought a brief battle with herself in
silence. To bare the details of the story was like uncovering
her heart to the world, but she saw the sympathy in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
Murray’s eyes, and she was personally helpless
in a most trying emergency. She sorely needed a
guiding hand.
</p>
<p>
“Albert and I were engaged to be married,” she
said at last, with simple frankness. “We had some
trifling quarrel, and then this woman came between
us. He was not rich, but he had some property and
excellent prospects, and—well, they were married. It
was an elopement—a matter of momentary pique, he
told me afterward. God knows I never tried to interfere
with their married life, and she had no reason to
be jealous of me. I did not even see either of them,
except at rare intervals, for a long time, but she could
not forget or forgive the fact that we had been a great
deal to each other. And she was selfish and extravagant.
I am merely repeating the judgment of her own
friends in this, for I do not wish to be unjust to her,
even now. After I had forsaken society and become a
trained nurse I heard something of their troubles:
they were living beyond his income, and his income did
not increase according to expectations. Perhaps the
worry of such conditions made him less capable of improving
his opportunities. At any rate, her extravagance
created a great deal of comment, and he has
told me since that they quarreled frequently over
financial matters. Then I heard that they had separated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
and that he had given her nearly all of the little
he had left. I was not trying to keep track of them
or pry into their affairs, but there were mutual friends,
and I could not help hearing what was common gossip.
But I studiously avoided any chance of meeting either
of them—until I heard that he was sick and alone.
Then I went to him and cared for him. It was not
proper, you will say? Perhaps not. It put me in a
false position and invited scandal? Perhaps it did.
But I went, and I would go again; I was there to
soothe his last moments; I was with him when all
others had forsaken him, and there is nothing in this
life that I would not sacrifice for the glory of that
memory!”
</p>
<p>
The light of self-sacrificing love shone in her eyes
as she made this final declaration, and Murray did not
trust himself to speak for a moment or two. The
story had been told so quietly, so simply, that the
sudden emphasis at the conclusion was almost irresistible
in the sublimity of its self-denying love. The
great contrast between the two women made it all the
stronger.
</p>
<p>
“I shall consider it my personal privilege,” replied
Murray, “to see that everything possible is
done.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said the nurse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
“But there are still some points that will have to be
cleared up,” continued Murray. “What made you
think the policy was in your name?”
</p>
<p>
“He told me he would have it changed, so that I
could pay all the bills in case of his death,” said the
nurse.
</p>
<p>
“Possibly,” remarked Murray, “he thought he
could, but to permit a change in the beneficiary without
the consent of the original beneficiary would be a
blow at the very structure of life insurance. It would
put a true and devoted wife at the absolute mercy of
an unscrupulous or thoughtless husband: he could
change the policy without her knowledge; he could
sell it for the cash-surrender value; he could transfer
it to a loan-shark to meet his personal or business
needs—in fact, it would be no more than so much
stock that could be reached by any creditor, and the
trusting wife might find herself penniless. In this
particular case the inability to make such a change
may work injustice, but the ability to make it would
work far greater injustice in practically all other instances.
Mr. Vincent may have thought he could do
this, and it is the very exceptional case when I most
heartily wish it had been possible, but he doubtless
made inquiries and found that it was not. When the
beneficiary can be deprived of her interest without her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
knowledge and consent the value of insurance will be
gone.”
</p>
<p>
“Then that is what he learned,” she remarked, as if
a question had been answered. “He was dreadfully
worried before he became too ill to give much thought
to business matters,” she added by way of explanation.
“I thought it was because I was using my own little
hoard to pay expenses, and, on the doctor’s advice, I
went with him twice in a cab to see about some things
that were worrying him, although even then he had
no business to leave his bed. It was the lesser of two
evils, the doctor said, for his mental distress was affecting
his physical condition seriously. He said he never
could rest until he had provided for those who had
been good to him in adversity. But he didn’t mean
me!” she exclaimed quickly. “He meant the doctor
and some others who had been generous in the matter
of credit. He knew why I—” She paused a moment,
and then added: “But he wanted the others paid, and
there was no one else he could trust.”
</p>
<p>
“I quite understand,” said Murray encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
“He made me stay in the cab both times,” she went
on, “and the second time—when he had me sign his
wife’s name—he seemed—”
</p>
<p>
“Had you sign his wife’s name!” exclaimed Murray.
“To what?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she answered. “It was a formality,
he said, to straighten out some tangle, so I did it. I
would have done anything to ease his mind and get
him back to bed.”
</p>
<p>
Murray gave a low whistle. He was beginning to
understand the situation.
</p>
<p>
“Pardon me, Miss—” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Bronson—Amy Bronson,” she explained.
</p>
<p>
Murray had heard of Miss Bronson some years before.
She had suddenly given up society to become a
trained nurse, and there had been vague rumors of an
unhappy love affair. Later, her father’s death had
left her dependent upon her own resources, and society
had commented on what a fortunate thing it was that
she had already chosen an occupation and fitted herself
for it. He never had known her, and only a bare
suggestion of the story had come to his notice, but it
was sufficient to make him more than ever her champion
now.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Bronson,” he said, “I fear there are greater
complications here than I had supposed. Did Mr.
Vincent get any money on either of those trips?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. On the second he told me that he closed up
an old deal, and he was more contented after that.
After the first he was so dreadfully disturbed, that I
never dared ask him any questions.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where the insurance policy is?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I searched for it before coming here, but
could find no trace of it.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was as considerate as the circumstances
would permit, but he had become suddenly business-like.
Aside from the question of sympathy, the matter
was now one to interest him deeply. He had been
groping blindly before, but with light came the possibility
of action.
</p>
<p>
“You are alone?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Entirely so.”
</p>
<p>
“If you will go back,” said Murray, reaching for
his desk telephone, “Mrs. Murray will be there as soon
as a cab can carry her. I would go myself, but I think
I can be of better service to you for the moment by remaining
here.”
</p>
<p>
As soon as she had gone and he had telephoned to
his wife, Murray made some inquiries of the clerks in
the outer office and learned of a sick man who had
asked about the possibility of changing the beneficiary
of a policy. The visit had been made some time before,
but the man was so evidently ill and in such deep
distress that the circumstances had been impressed on
the mind of the clerk who had answered his questions.
</p>
<p>
“That accounts for one trip,” mused Murray.
“Now for the loan-shark that he saw on the other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
We’ll hear from him pretty soon, and then there will
be some lively times.”
</p>
<p>
Murray had had experience with the ways of loan-sharks
before, and he was confident that he now had
the whole story. Vincent was out of money and desperate;
he knew that Miss Bronson had been using her
own money, and that not one cent of it would his wife
pay back; he had tried to have the beneficiary of the
policy changed, and had failed. Then, determined to
get something out of the policy, he had gone to a loan-shark.
The unscrupulous money-lender, getting an
exorbitant rate of interest, could afford to be less particular
about the wife’s signature. He would run the
risk of forgery, confident that the policy would be redeemed
to prevent a scandal, no matter what happened.
Indeed, in some cases a loan-shark would a little
rather have a forgery than the genuine signature,
for it gives him an additional hold on the interested
parties and lessens the likelihood of a resort to law
over the question of usurious interest.
</p>
<p>
“The scoundrel will come,” said Murray, and the
scoundrel came by invitation. A formal notification
that he held an assignment of the policy arrived first,
and that gave his name and address and enabled Murray
to telephone him. A loan-shark does not lose much
time in matters of this sort. Neither did Murray in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
this case, for his invitation to call was prompt and imperative,
even to setting the exact time for the call.
And a message was sent to Mrs. Albert Vincent, also.
</p>
<p>
“What’s your interest in that policy?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“A thousand dollars,” replied the money-lender.
</p>
<p>
“A thousand dollars!” ejaculated the startled Murray.
“What the devil did he do with the money?”
</p>
<p>
“That is something that does not concern me,” said
the money-lender carelessly.
</p>
<p>
The confidence and carelessness of the reply recalled
Murray to a consciousness of the situation. He had a
sharp and hard game to play with a clever and unscrupulous
man.
</p>
<p>
“How much did you loan him?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“The note is for a thousand dollars,” was the
prompt reply.
</p>
<p>
“How much did you loan him, Shylock?” repeated
Murray, and the money-lender was startled out of his
complacent confidence.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t come here to be insulted!” he exclaimed.
“I hold the policy and the assignment of it as security.
If you can’t talk business, as man to man, I’ll quit and
leave the matter to a lawyer.”
</p>
<p>
“If you put one foot outside of that door,” retorted
Murray, “we’ll fight this matter to a finish, Shylock,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
and we’ll get some points on your business methods.
Come back and sit down.”
</p>
<p>
The money-lender had made a pretense of leaving,
but he paused and met the cold, hard look of Murray.
Then he came back.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we take risks,” he said apologetically.
</p>
<p>
“Mighty few,” commented Murray uncompromisingly.
</p>
<p>
“If a man has security that is good at the bank he
won’t come to us,” persisted the money-lender. “We
have to protect ourselves for the additional risk.”
</p>
<p>
“By getting a man to put himself in the shadow of
the penitentiary,” said Murray. “I know all about
you people, Shylock. How much did you loan?”
</p>
<p>
The money-lender was angered almost to the point
of defiance—but not quite. Loan-sharks do not easily
reach that point: the very nature of their business
makes it inadvisable, except when some poor devil is in
their power.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, of course, if it’s a personal matter with you,”
he said, “I might scale it a little. The note is for a
thousand dollars, with various incidental charges that
make it now a thousand and eighty dollars. I might
knock off a hundred from that.”
</p>
<p>
“How much did you loan him, Shylock?” repeated
Murray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
“Nine hundred dollars,” answered the money-lender
in desperation.
</p>
<p>
“Shylock,” said Murray with cold deliberation, “I
know you people. If I didn’t, I might ask to see the
canceled check, but that would prove nothing. You
give a check for the full amount, but the man has to
put up a cash bonus when he gets it. How much did
you loan him?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stand on the note,” declared the money-lender
angrily. “I know my rights, and I can be as ugly as
you. The note is signed by himself and his wife, and
you’ll have a hard time going back of it.”
</p>
<p>
Murray touched a bell and a boy answered.
</p>
<p>
“Ask Mrs. Vincent to step in here,” said Murray.
</p>
<p>
The money-lender was plainly disconcerted, but he
was not unaccustomed to hard battles, so he nerved
himself to bluff the thing through, it being too late to
do anything else.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Vincent,” said Murray, when the woman appeared,
“I have found the insurance policy.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is it?” she asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Shylock,”—with a motion toward the money-lender,—“holds
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Give it to me, Mr. Shylock,” demanded Mrs. Vincent,
who was not a woman to grasp the bitter insult
of the name, and her innocent repetition of it added to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
the anger of the man. Still, the habit of never letting
his personal feelings interfere with business was strong
within him.
</p>
<p>
“I must be paid first,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Paid!” she cried. “What is there to pay? The insurance
money is mine!”
</p>
<p>
“I hold a note,” insisted the money-lender.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that to me?” she retorted. “Do you think
I’m going to pay his debts? I didn’t contract them; I
wasn’t with him; he left me years ago! Let <em>her</em> look
out for the debts! Give me the policy or I’ll have you
arrested!”
</p>
<p>
The woman was wildly and covetously excited: she
would not rest easy until the actual possession of the
money assured her that there was no possibility of a
slip. The money-lender, too, was anxious. Murray
alone seemed to be taking the matter quietly, for
these two were now playing the game for him,
although the details required his close attention. A
very slight miscalculation might carry it beyond his
control.
</p>
<p>
“It’s assigned to me,” said the money-lender with a
pretense of confidence. “I have your signature.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s a lie!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” interrupted Murray quietly; “it’s a
forgery.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“That woman!” exclaimed Mrs. Vincent. “She stole
my name as well as my husband!”
</p>
<p>
“That man,” corrected Murray. “He did it for the
woman who did so much for him. He would have given
her all, if he could.”
</p>
<p>
Murray had reason to know that it was the nurse,
but he lied cheerfully in what he considered a good
cause. They were getting to the critical and dangerous
point in the game he was playing: the widow
would be merciless to the nurse.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a forgery, anyway!” declared Mrs. Vincent.
“I won’t pay a cent!”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll sue,” said the money-lender threateningly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, sue!” she cried. “What do I care? You
can’t get anything on a forgery. I guess I know that
much.”
</p>
<p>
“It will make a scandal,” said the money-lender insinuatingly.
</p>
<p>
“Let it,” she retorted angrily.
</p>
<p>
They were again making points for Murray, each
showing the weakness of the other’s position, so Murray
merely watched and waited.
</p>
<p>
“If there is another woman in the case,” persisted
the money-lender, who had been quick to grasp the
significance of the previous remarks, “the shame and
disgrace—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“What do I care?” she interrupted. “The disgrace
is for her.”
</p>
<p>
“And for him,” said the money-lender. “I can
make him out a forger.”
</p>
<p>
“It won’t give you the money,” she argued.
</p>
<p>
“It will make you the widow of a criminal,” he
threatened. “How would you like the disgrace of
that? And the other things! If I have to go to court
the whole scandal will be revealed and the very name
you bear will be a shame! The widow of a forger! A
woman who could not hold her husband! An object of
pitying contempt, so small that she would not pay an
honest debt to protect the name that is hers!” In his
anxiety not to lose, the money-lender became almost
eloquent in picturing possible conditions. No other
sentiment or emotion could have given him this power.
And he saw that the effect was not lost upon the
woman, for no one knew better than she the harm the
exploitation of the whole miserable story would do.
Even a blameless woman can not entirely escape the
obloquy that attaches to the name she bears, and there
had been enough already to make it difficult for Mrs.
Vincent to retain a position on the fringe of society.
“Of course,” he went on, “if you’d rather stand this
than pay, there is nothing for me to do but leave and
put the matter in the hands of a lawyer.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute, Shylock,” interrupted Murray.
“Mrs. Vincent is going to pay—something.”
</p>
<p>
“Pay money that he got for <em>her</em>!” she exclaimed
with sudden resentfulness. “She’s the forger, anyway;
I know it!”
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever see her, Shylock?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“He came alone,” replied the money-lender, “with
the assignment of policy ready, and he swore to it.”
</p>
<p>
“That settles that,” said Murray with apparent
conviction. “It would be a thankless task to try to
prove that any one else forged the signature, and
neither one of you is in a position to seek any court
notoriety. Now, Shylock, after deducting the bonus
and all trumped-up charges, how much did you loan?”
</p>
<p>
“Nine hundred dollars,” said the money-lender
desperately.
</p>
<p>
“Try again, Shylock,” urged Murray. “You never
loaned any such sum under any such circumstances.”
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t stop insulting me,” exclaimed the
money-lender angrily, “I’ll quit right now and take
my chances with the law.”
</p>
<p>
“You haven’t any chances with the law, Shylock,”
retorted Murray. “You can make a scandal, but you
can’t get a damn cent. That’s why you’re going to be
reasonable. How much did you loan? You’d better be
honest with me, for it’s your only chance.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take eight hundred dollars, with the interest
charges.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll take an even seven hundred dollars,” said
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“But the interest!” cried the money-lender. “Don’t
I get any interest?”
</p>
<p>
“Aha!” exclaimed Murray. “I guessed it right,
didn’t I? That’s just what you loaned. You see,
others have hypothecated policies with you people, and
I’ve learned something of the business. There are
more peculiar deals tried with insurance policies than
with any other form of security. But you don’t get
any interest, Shylock: you get your principal back,
and you’re lucky to get that.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s robbery!” complained the money-lender.
</p>
<p>
“It’s generosity,” said Murray. “You ought to lose
it all.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t pay it!” declared Mrs. Vincent, and Murray
turned sharply to her.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Vincent,” he said, “you will pay this sum to
Shylock out of the policy, and you will pay all the
bills, including the cost of the funeral, which I advanced.
You will not do this as a matter of generosity,
or even of justice, but from purely selfish motives.
If you, being able to prevent it, permitted this scandal
to come to light, you would be eternally disgraced:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
doors would be closed to you everywhere. God knows
it is bad enough as it is, but this would make it infinitely
worse. Even where no real blame attaches to
her, there is always criticism and contempt for the
woman who lets another take her husband from her,
and a repudiation of the expenses of his last illness or
any other bills, when you are getting the insurance,
would condemn you absolutely in the eyes of all people
who knew the circumstances. For this reason, you
are going to do what I say, and you are going to make
the necessary arrangements now. For similar selfish
reasons, Shylock is going to do what I say, and he is
going to make the necessary arrangements now. If
either of you balk at the terms, I’ll drop the whole
matter and let you fight it out, to your mutual trouble
and loss.”
</p>
<p>
Neither dared take the risk, for each feared that,
without Murray, the other would gain the advantage.
Neither was in a position to defy the other, and Murray
had forced concessions from each that the other
could not. He was clearly master of the situation.
</p>
<p>
“Do you accept the terms?” he demanded. “If not,
get out!”
</p>
<p>
“It’s brutal, outrageous!” declared the woman.
</p>
<p>
“A swindle!” exclaimed the man.
</p>
<p>
“That will do, Shylock,” cautioned Murray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
“There is nothing to be said except ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and
only thirty seconds in which to say that. I’ve reached
the limit of my patience.”
</p>
<p>
He took out his watch and began to count the seconds.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
When they were gone Murray sent for Amy Bronson,
the nurse.
</p>
<p>
“I was just coming to see you,” she explained when
she arrived. “I finally found a note hidden away
among Albert’s effects. It contained five one hundred-dollar
bills and the scribbled line, ‘I have tried to do
more for you, but can not.’”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t see how he could have spent all the
money,” mused Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Now I can pay the bills,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Murray. “A memorandum of all that
he owed is to be sent to me. Mrs. Vincent will pay
everything.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Vincent!” cried the nurse. “Impossible! I
couldn’t have so misjudged her.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think you misjudged her,” returned Murray,
“but,”—whimsically,—“I’m a wonder at argument.
You ought to hear me argue. Mrs. Vincent decided
to take my view of the matter with the insurance.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
“But the five hundred dollars!” said Miss Bronson.
</p>
<p>
“Keep it,” said Murray. “He intended it for you,
and it is little enough. I’m only sorry that the ten-thousand-dollar
policy is not for you, also, but it is
one of the incidental hardships that arise from an
ordinarily wise provision of the law.”
</p>
<p>
The nurse’s lip quivered and the tears came to her
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I was an entire stranger to you, Mr. Murray,” she
said, “but you have been very good to me when I most
needed a friend. I—I don’t know how I can—”
</p>
<p>
“I have been amply repaid for all I have done,” said
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“How?” she asked in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I have had the royal satisfaction,” he answered,
“of compelling an unscrupulous man and a selfish
woman to do a fairly creditable thing; I have had the
joy of showing my contempt for them in my very
method of doing this.”
</p>
<p>
She did not quite understand, her gratitude making
her blind to all else at the moment.
</p>
<p>
“And also,” added Murray to himself, when she had
gone, “the great satisfaction of saving a devoted
woman from the consequences of at least one of her
acts of devotion. Forgery is a serious matter, regardless
of the circumstances.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span><a name='c6' id='c6'></a>AN INCIDENTAL ERROR</h2>
<p>
“It’s mighty awkward,” said Owen Ross, the insurance
solicitor.
</p>
<p>
“It is,” admitted Dave Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been after him for over six months,” persisted
Ross, “and now, after urging him persistently to take
out a policy, I have got to tell him that we won’t give
him one. That would be hard enough if he had sought
us out, and it’s ten times as hard when we have sought
him. Why, it looks as if we were playing a heartless
practical joke on him.”
</p>
<p>
“But it can’t be helped,” said Murray. “It’s one of
the disagreeable features of the business. We convince
a man that it’s to his interest to carry life insurance,
and then we tell him he can’t have any. Naturally,
from his prejudiced viewpoint, we seem to be contemptibly
insincere and deceitful.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, we are in no sense shortening his life,”
remarked Ross, “but it seems like pronouncing a sentence
of death, just the same. He is sure to make an
awful row about it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“One man,” said Murray reminiscently, “fell dead
in this office when his application was refused. The
shock killed him, but there was no way to avoid giving
him the shock. However, that was an exceptional case:
I never knew of another to succumb, although it must
be admitted that the news that one is destined not to
live long is distressing and depressing.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s the reason for refusing Tucker?” asked
Ross.
</p>
<p>
“There are several reasons,” replied Murray. “The
physician reports heart murmur, which indicates some
latent trouble that is almost certain to develop into a
serious affection.”
</p>
<p>
“May not the physician be wrong?”
</p>
<p>
“He is paid to be right, but, of course, we are all
liable to make mistakes, and it can’t be denied that
heart murmur is deceptive. I’ve known men to be the
subject of unfavorable reports at one hour of the day
and most favorable ones at another. The occupation
immediately preceding the examination may develop
symptoms that are normally absent. However, I would
not feel justified in accepting this application, even if
the report were favorable.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” demanded Ross.
</p>
<p>
“The amount of insurance he wishes to carry would
make him worth more dead than alive, which is a condition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
of affairs that an insurance company dislikes.”
Murray became reminiscent again. “I recall one such
risk,” he went on. “The man found the premiums a
greater burden than he could carry, so he died.”
</p>
<p>
“Suicide!” exclaimed Ross.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no,” replied Murray, with a peculiar smile;
“merely a mistake. But, if you will put yourself in
that man’s place, you will see how the mistake could
happen. He was carrying twenty-five thousand dollars
of insurance, and he wasn’t worth twenty-five cents
at the time, owing to some recent reverses. He was ill,
but was not considered dangerously ill. Still, he was
depressed, believing apparently that he would not recover
and knowing that he had not the money for the
next premium. If he died before a certain date there
would be twenty-five thousand dollars for his wife and
children; if he died after that date there would be
comparatively little. Now, in imagination, just assume
the problem that confronted that man on a certain
night: twenty-four hours of life for him meant a
future of privation for his wife, if he did not recover
and prosper, while immediate death for him meant
comfort for those he loved. Picture yourself contemplating
that prospect while lying weak and discouraged
in the sick-room, with various bottles—one
labeled ‘Poison’—within reach. A poison may have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
medicinal value when properly used, you know, but
what more natural than that you should make a mistake
in the gloom of the night while the tired nurse is
dozing? It is so easy to get the wrong bottle—to take
the poison instead of the tonic—and it solves a most
distressing problem. A drop of the poison is beneficial;
a teaspoonful is death; and the tonic is to be taken in
large doses.” Murray paused a moment to let the terrible
nature of the situation impress itself on Ross.
Then he added quietly: “We paid the insurance, although
the timeliness of the accident did not escape
comment. The same mistake twenty-four hours later
would not have had the same financial result. Now, do
you understand why I would not care to put fifty thousand
dollars on the life of Tucker, even if he were
physically satisfactory? Unexpected reverses may
make any man worth more dead than alive, but we seldom
contribute knowingly to such a condition of affairs.
It isn’t prudent. While the average man is not
disposed to shorten his life to beat an insurance company,
it isn’t wise to put the temptation in his way
unless you are very sure of your man.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we needn’t explain that to Tucker,” said
Ross.
</p>
<p>
“No,” returned Murray. “We can put the whole
thing on the basis of the physician’s report.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish you would break the news to him,” urged
Ross. “You can do it with better grace, for you were
not instrumental in getting him to put in his application.
He’ll be up here to-day.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very well,” returned Murray. “I’ll see him
when he comes.”
</p>
<p>
Though the task was far from pleasant, Murray
had been long enough in the business to take matters
philosophically. One must accustom oneself to the
disagreeable features of any occupation, for there is
none that is entirely pleasurable.
</p>
<p>
Tucker, however, did not make this interview disagreeable
in the way that was expected: instead of
becoming discouraged and depressed, he became indignant.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” he cried. “You don’t consider me a
good risk?”
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to say,” returned Murray, “that our
physician does not report favorably on you.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he doesn’t!” exclaimed Tucker. “Well, that’s
a good joke on the doctor, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“What!”
</p>
<p>
“You’d better discharge him and get a man with
some sense.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought,” said Murray dubiously, “that it might
seem rather hard on you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hard on me!” ejaculated Tucker. “Hard on the
company, you mean! You’re letting a little two-by-four
doctor steer you away from a good thing. Why,
say! I’m good for as long a life as an elephant!”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure I hope so.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s robbery—plain robbery—for that doctor to
take a fee from you for making such a report on me.
I’ll show him up!”
</p>
<p>
“How?” asked Murray curiously.
</p>
<p>
“By living!” declared Tucker. “It’s going to give
me infinite pleasure to report to you from time to time
and show you one of the healthiest men that ever was
turned down by an insurance company. He can’t scare
me into a decline—not any! And, say! he looks to me
like a young man.”
</p>
<p>
“He is.”
</p>
<p>
“A young man in fine physical condition.”
</p>
<p>
“He is.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll go to his funeral, and I’ll be in prime
condition when he’s put away! You tell him that, will
you? I’ll be walking when he has to be carried.”
</p>
<p>
Now, this was rather annoying to Murray. It was
preferable to the despair that overwhelmed some men
in similar circumstances, but it seemed to him that
Tucker was overdoing it.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” said Murray resentfully, “we would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
care to put fifty thousand dollars on your life, for it’s
more than a man in your position ought to carry.
You’ll never be worth as much alive as you would be
dead, with that insurance.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I won’t!” retorted Tucker sarcastically. “Well,
now, instead of making the girl I am to marry a present
of a policy on my life, I’ll just make her a present
of your whole blamed company in a few years. You
watch what I do with the money you might have had!”
</p>
<p>
“You are about to marry?” asked Murray with interest.
“It’s a serious matter, in view of the physician’s
report.”
</p>
<p>
“Marriage is always a serious matter,” asserted
Tucker. “I don’t have to have a doctor tell me that.
But he can’t scare me out with flubdub about heart
murmur, for I know the heart was murmuring, and
the prospective Mrs. Tucker does, too. She’ll interpret
that murmur for him any time he wants a little enlightenment.”
</p>
<p>
Murray laughed when Tucker had gone. The man’s
indignation had been momentarily irritating, but there
was something amusing about it, too.
</p>
<p>
“He’s going to live to a green old age, just to spite
the company,” mused Murray. “It’s a matter of no
great personal interest to him, but he’d like to make
the company feel bad. If a man could order his life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
as he can his business affairs, there would be mighty
little chance for us.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Tucker was hastening to the home of
Miss Frances Greer.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve come to release you,” he announced cheerfully.
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t want to be released,” she returned.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” he said. “I didn’t suppose you
would. But you might just as well know that you’re
getting a poor risk.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I wanted to put fifty thousand dollars on my
life, as a precaution for the future, and the fool of an
insurance doctor turned me down.”
</p>
<p>
“What do I care about the doctor!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing, of course.”
</p>
<p>
“Or insurance!”
</p>
<p>
“Still less.”
</p>
<p>
“And,” she said happily, “you’re a good enough
risk for me.”
</p>
<p>
Then they went into executive session and decided
that insurance doctors didn’t know anything, anyway.
But they did not forget Dave Murray, and they did
not let Dave Murray forget them: he heard from them
indirectly in the most annoying ways. His wife informed
him less than a week later that she had met
Miss Greer at a reception.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
</p>
<p>
“A most extraordinary girl!” his wife remarked.
“I can’t understand her at all. She asked me in a most
ingenuous way if I ever had noticed any indications of
heart murmur about you.
</p>
<p>
“‘Never,’ said I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not even in the engagement days when he was
making love?’ she insisted.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not even then,’ I answered, bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“‘He couldn’t have been much of a lover,’ she remarked.”
</p>
<p>
Murray laughed and explained the situation to his
wife. But Murray would have been better pleased if
the two women had not met, for he had no desire to
have this case perpetually present in the more intimate
associations of life. However, he had to make the best
of it, even when he was invited to the wedding, to which
his wife insisted that he should go. She had discovered
that the bride was related to an intimate friend of her
own girlhood days, and the bride further showed flattering
gratification in this discovery. She was especially
gracious to Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I want to ask you a question,” she told him.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon Murray made heroic efforts to escape
before she could find a suitable opportunity, but she
beckoned him back whenever he got near the door.
</p>
<p>
“Mama,” she said finally, for this happened during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
the wedding reception, and her mother stood near
her, “I wish you would take charge of Mr. Murray
and see that he doesn’t run away. I have something
very important to say to him before Ralph and I
leave.”
</p>
<p>
Thus the unhappy Murray was held until the bride
and groom were ready to depart, when the bride finally
succeeded in getting him alone for a minute.
</p>
<p>
“I wanted to ask you, as a particular favor to me,”
she said appealingly, “to let Ralph live a little while—that
is, if your doctor won’t make too big a row
about it.”
</p>
<p>
Then she laughed merrily. There could be no doubt
at all that Mrs. Ralph Tucker refused absolutely to
worry about the health of Mr. Ralph Tucker; she had
simply put the doctor down as an ignoramus. And
Mr. Ralph Tucker’s appearance certainly was not that
of a man in poor physical condition. However, Murray
knew how deceptive appearances may be, and,
while no physician is infallible, it is necessary to
rely on their judgment. Nor was it a joking matter,
in his opinion. He was glad that the young people
could look at the future without misgivings, but a
really serious matter ought not to be treated so lightly.
</p>
<p>
It was about a week later that a note came to Murray
from Mrs. Tucker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
“So grateful to you for sparing Ralph so long,” it
read.
</p>
<p>
Murray crumpled it up and, with some rather warm
remarks, threw it in the waste-basket.
</p>
<p>
“Why did I relieve Ross of his disagreeable task?”
he grumbled.
</p>
<p>
Then he began to count the days that would precede
their return from the bridal trip, for he was sure they
would call on him. There could be no doubt that Mrs.
Tucker had deliberately planned to make things as
uncomfortable for him as possible, and there was every
reason to believe that Tucker himself was aiding and
abetting her.
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t fair,” he muttered, “to make it appear that
this is a personal matter with me. The Lord knows I
haven’t anything to do with his lease of life.”
</p>
<p>
This was just after he had received a telegram to
the effect that “the patient is doing as well as can be
expected,” and Ross, who happened in the office at the
time, noticed that his chief looked at him reproachfully.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Ross.
</p>
<p>
“Hereafter,” returned Murray morosely, “my solicitors
have got to carry their own burdens. If Tucker
and his wife put me in an insane asylum, the administrator
of my estate will surely sue you for big damages. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
never thought I was getting a life sentence
when I let you unload on me.”
</p>
<p>
The physician also noticed a growing coolness and
was moved to ask what was wrong.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you make a mistake in the Tucker case?”
Murray inquired by way of reply. “I don’t wish
Tucker any harm, but I’m doomed to an early death
if he isn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see what his life has to do with yours,” retorted
the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“That’s because you don’t know Mrs. Tucker,” replied
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“He was an impossible risk,” asserted the doctor.
“The indications of serious trouble may entirely disappear,
under favorable conditions of life, but they
were there when I made the examination. Ours is not
yet an exact science, and the human system frequently
fools us. You recall the Denton case, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“At twenty the doctors, including his family physician,
gave him not more than two or three years to
live, and at twenty-five he was considered a good risk
for any insurance company. He is nearly thirty-five
now, has one policy in this company, and we would be
glad to let him have another.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’re all right, Doctor, of course,” returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
Murray. “We must be careful to err on the safe side,
if we err at all, in this business. But I wish the Tuckers
would transfer their attentions to you. I’ll be
tempted to jump out of the window when I see them
coming in the door.”
</p>
<p>
The Tuckers, however, were not to be escaped.
After an interval of about three weeks they sent him
another telegram, which read: “If we retire to a ranch,
will you lengthen the lease of life a little?” Then they
came back and called on him.
</p>
<p>
“So kind of you to let us have this trip,” said Mrs.
Tucker with every evidence of deep gratitude. “Poor
Ralph appreciates it.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Ralph was looking as big and strong and
happy as it was possible for a man to look, and Murray
was correspondingly uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
“The premiums on fifty thousand dollars would have
been pretty heavy,” remarked Tucker with a cheerful
grin.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” admitted Murray weakly.
</p>
<p>
“I had a tidy little sum put aside to care for them,”
Tucker explained. “We thought it would interest
your company to know that we put that money into a
small ranch out west, so it is entirely out of reach
now. You don’t mind my choosing a restful place for
my early demise, do you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“Now, see here!” cried Murray, but Mrs. Tucker
interrupted him.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he wouldn’t be so cruel as that!” she exclaimed.
“Show him what the doctor said, Ralph.”
</p>
<p>
Tucker spread a sheet of paper on the desk before
Murray, and the latter read: “This is to certify that
I have made a careful examination of Ralph Tucker,
and I believe him to be in excellent physical condition.
I attach slight importance to the indications of incipient
heart trouble, which, with reasonable care and
proper treatment, should disappear entirely.” This
was signed by a noted specialist.
</p>
<p>
“And the next,” said Mrs. Tucker.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon Tucker laid this before Murray: “The
heart murmur noted I believe to be due to temporary
causes and not to any permanent affection. On the occasion
of one examination there were no indications of
it at all.” This also was signed by a well-known physician.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Ralph!” sighed Mrs. Tucker, and Murray
felt that the burden of this case was greater than he
could bear.
</p>
<p>
“They don’t agree entirely,” he asserted aggressively.
</p>
<p>
“No,” admitted Tucker, “but I understand that’s
not unusual in such cases.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“And they don’t agree with your doctor at all,”
added Mrs. Tucker. “But, of course, your doctor is
right. Poor Ralph!”
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t do that,” pleaded Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Ralph!” sighed Mrs. Tucker again. “The
doctors don’t think he’ll live more than a lifetime.”
</p>
<p>
“Put in another application and take another examination,”
urged Murray in despair. “The doctor
may have been misled by some trifling temporary
trouble.”
</p>
<p>
“What would be the use?” asked Tucker. “I’ve already
invested the premium money in a small ranch.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s too bad,” remarked Mrs. Tucker lugubriously.
“That money would have done the company so much
good.”
</p>
<p>
“This has ceased to be a joke!” declared Murray
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“A joke!” exclaimed Mrs. Tucker. “Has it ever
been a joke with you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, it hasn’t,” said Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t think you could be so heartless,” asserted
Mrs. Tucker. “One has only to look at poor Ralph—”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t, don’t!” cried Murray. “On what terms will
you quit this?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you want to get down to business,” put in
Tucker, “I’d like to begin delivering this company to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
Frances. You know I said I was going to do it. I
don’t care for policies, but I might take some stock.”
</p>
<p>
“You said you had no money.”
</p>
<p>
“No premium money,” corrected Tucker. “I invested
that in the ranch, but I was notified this morning
of a legacy from a bachelor uncle that will give
me some ready cash.”
</p>
<p>
“The stock of this company gets on the market very
seldom,” explained Murray. “I have a little myself,
but I don’t care to part with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, very well,” replied Tucker in careless tones;
“it’s quite immaterial to us for the moment. In fact,
I’d be in no hurry about it at all if I only had a longer
time to live.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor Ralph!” sighed Mrs. Tucker, as they departed.
</p>
<p>
When they had gone, Murray rang for his office-boy.
</p>
<p>
“You tell Mr. Ross,” he said to the boy, “to keep
out of my way for a few days. I’m not in a mental
condition to stand the sight of the man who loaded this
trouble on me.”
</p>
<p>
For the next three days Murray saw as little of his
office as he possibly could, fearing another call from
Mr. and Mrs. Tucker. Then he learned that they had
left again for the West, and he breathed more freely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
But, shortly thereafter, a stock-broker called upon
him.
</p>
<p>
“I am commissioned,” said the broker, “to buy some
stock in your company, and I thought possibly you
might know of some that is for sale.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not,” replied Murray. “As you know, it is
not a speculative stock, but is held, for the most part,
by conservative investors. A little gets on the market
occasionally, when some estate is being settled or some
holder becomes financially embarrassed, but that is
about your only chance.”
</p>
<p>
“So my client informed me,” said the broker, “but
he also informed me that he was sure he could get some
himself, and he wished me to use every effort to add to
his prospective holdings.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Tucker, your client, tried to buy some from
me before he left for the West,” said Murray, for he
had no doubt as to the identity of the man who wanted
the stock.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed!” returned the broker. “I didn’t know that.
He explained his anxiety for prompt action by the
rather extraordinary statement that he wished to get
the stock before somebody foreclosed on his life!”
</p>
<p>
“By thunder!” cried Murray, “somebody <em>will</em> foreclose
on his life, and take the Limited west to do it, if
he keeps this thing up!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
</p>
<p>
In some amazement, the broker apologized and retired,
and Murray began to wonder what would happen
to him if Mrs. Tucker ever did get enough of the
stock to make her influence felt. Of course, there was
little chance of that, but even a small stock-holder
could be annoying when so disposed. He began to
dream about the Tucker case, and an incidental mention
of it in the office would make the atmosphere unpleasant
for the day. Every clerk and solicitor understood
that it was a dangerous topic. Once the name
“Tucker” was mentioned in the ordinary course of
business, and Murray had things at a fever heat before
it could be explained to him that it was another
Tucker. Then came a letter from the West, with a
Tucker return card on the envelop. A council of war
was held before it was delivered to Murray, and even
then a time was chosen when he was absent to lay it
on his desk. It was very brief—just an announcement
that “the patient” had rallied splendidly after the
fatigue of the journey and exhibited “really wonderful
vitality for a sick man.” No one cared to go near
Murray all the rest of that day.
</p>
<p>
Soon after the first of the following month another
missive arrived—a mere formal affidavit, headed “Certificate
of Life,” and solemnly averring that “Ralph
Tucker’s heart has not ceased to murmur along in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
land of the living.” This was followed a month later
by a certificate from a physician to the effect that “a
restful ranch life is especially conducive to longevity,
and Mr. Tucker’s health continues to show all the
improvement that can be expected in a man who had
nothing the matter with him in the first place.”
</p>
<p>
These facetious reports continued to arrive at
monthly intervals for a period of nearly a year. Usually
they were brief, but occasionally the doctor, who
seemed to enter into the spirit of the affair, would go
into such details as weight, endurance, appetite, lifting
power, respiration and—heart murmur. “The
heart,” he wrote at one time, “seems to be too well
satisfied to murmur now, and the patient was able to
sit up and eat a large steak to-day, after which a little
gentle exercise—about twenty miles on horseback—seemed
to do him some good.”
</p>
<p>
Murray promptly turned this over to the company
doctor, and the latter sighed. Almost the only satisfaction
in life that Murray had during this time arose
from his ability to make the doctor miserable.
</p>
<p>
“He was not a good risk when I examined him,” the
doctor insisted, “but he may be a good one now. We
can’t be certain of results in such a case, and the law
of probabilities frequently works out wrong. He could
not have done a better thing, under the circumstances,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
than to go in for a simple, outdoor life. The basis
of trouble was there, in my judgment, but it may
have been overcome.”
</p>
<p>
“The basis of trouble is still there,” declared Murray;
“not only the basis of trouble, but the whole
blame structure, and it’s resting on us. I can feel the
weight.”
</p>
<p>
“So can I,” replied the doctor disconsolately.
</p>
<p>
Less than a week after this Tucker telegraphed to
know if Murray had changed his mind about disposing
of any stock.
</p>
<p>
“No,” was the reply sent back.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Tucker answered. “I just wanted to
give Mrs. Tucker another slice of your company. She
has a little of it already.”
</p>
<p>
Investigation showed that the broker had succeeded
in picking up a few shares, but hardly enough to exert
any considerable influence. Still, it was disquieting to
find the Tuckers so persistent.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet,” said Murray, “that mental worry has put
me where you wouldn’t pass me for a risk.”
</p>
<p>
“If your wife,” returned the doctor, “is anything
like Mrs. Tucker I’d pass you for any kind of risk
rather than incur her displeasure. They’ll begin to
take a stock-holder’s interest in the affairs of this particular
office pretty soon.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“The affairs are in good shape,” declared Murray.
</p>
<p>
“But a real determined stock-holder can stir up a
devil of a rumpus over nothing,” asserted the doctor.
“If she should send all those physicians’ reports to
headquarters, they would rather offset my report on
which he was turned down, and the company would
feel that it had lost a good thing. The company will
not stop to think that my report may have been justified
by conditions at the time.”
</p>
<p>
“And the risk that I thought too big for him then
may not seem too big for him now,” commented Murray
ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to examine him again,” said the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it would be safe,” returned Murray,
“unless you were searched for weapons first.”
</p>
<p>
So the doctor and Murray settled down to await,
with some anxiety, the next move in the game, and
their patience was rewarded by the receipt of five certificates
of health from as many different physicians,
each certificate having a message of some sort scribbled
across the top. “The patient had to ride a hundred
miles to get these,” Mrs. Tucker had written on the
first. “There were a few shares of this stock in my late
lamented uncle’s estate,” appeared in Tucker’s handwriting
on the second. “The president of your company
is rusticating a few miles from here,” Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
Tucker asserted on the third. “Better come out here
for a few days,” Tucker urged on the fourth. “Poor
Ralph!” was Mrs. Tucker’s comment on the fifth.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Dave Murray!” grumbled Murray, and he
and the doctor started West the next day. “Might as
well get this thing settled,” he said. “You and I have
got to be on harmonious terms with the stock-holders.
Besides, there’s an early grave yawning for me if I
don’t succeed in making peace with Mrs. Tucker. I
tell you, Doctor, when a woman decides to make things
uncomfortable for a man,—well, the man might just
as well resign himself to being perpetually uncomfortable.”
</p>
<p>
And yet, no one could have greeted them more graciously
than did Mrs. Tucker.
</p>
<p>
“I’m so glad you’ve come,” she said, “and brought
the doctor. It is particularly pleasing to have the doctor
here, for I want him to see if something can’t be
done for poor Ralph. I’m sure I don’t know what’s
going to become of the poor fellow. He doesn’t sleep
any better than a baby, and he can’t ride over a hundred
miles without getting tired. His muscles aren’t
a bit harder than iron, either, and his heart beats all
the time.”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Tucker,” said Murray appealingly, “what
can we do to make peace with you?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“Without even seeing your husband again,” added
the doctor, “I am willing to concede that he will live
to be three thousand years old.”
</p>
<p>
“We are beaten,” asserted Murray. “You have
humbled our business and professional pride. We give
Mr. Tucker none of the credit; it all belongs to you.
We claim to be the equals of any man, but of no
woman. Now, on what terms can we have peace?”
</p>
<p>
“I did want your insurance company for a sort of
belated wedding present,” said Mrs. Tucker thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“I’d give it to you if I could,” said Murray with
the utmost sincerity. “I assure you, that company
has been nothing but an annoyance to me ever since
you cast longing eyes on the stock.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’ve become more modest in my expectations,”
replied Mrs. Tucker cheerfully. “I don’t expect much
more than we’ve got now.”
</p>
<p>
“How much have you got?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Well, our broker picked up a few shares, and there
were some more in the estate of Ralph’s uncle, and the
president of the company kindly arranged it so that
we could get a little more. Such a delightful man he
is, too! It was when I heard he had a place in this vicinity,
where he came for an outing every year, that I
insisted upon Ralph’s buying this ranch. I thought it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
would be nice to be near him—and it was. We’re great
friends now, although he’s only here for a little while
in the spring and fall.”
</p>
<p>
“Did—did you tell him about the insurance?” asked
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“What insurance?” asked Mrs. Tucker blandly.
“We haven’t any insurance. Poor Ralph—”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Tucker,” interrupted Murray, “if you say
‘Poor Ralph’ again, you will see a driveling idiot
making streaks across the prairie. I have reached the
limit of endurance. All I want is peace, peace, peace,
and I’ll pay the price for it. Do you want some of
my stock?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, no,” she replied. “We’ve got it fixed now
so that Ralph is pretty sure to be a director next year.
We talked it over with the president.”
</p>
<p>
“Does Mr. Tucker still want a policy?” asked
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly not,” said Mrs. Tucker. “If he’s going
to die so soon, it would be beating the company, and
we’re part of the company now, so we—”
</p>
<p>
“Stop it! stop it!” pleaded Murray. “I’ll bet you
couldn’t kill him with an ax!”
</p>
<p>
“Sir!”
</p>
<p>
“I beg your pardon, but this is the climax of a year
of torment that I didn’t suppose was possible this side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
of the infernal regions,” explained Murray dismally,
“and I’m just naturally wondering why you brought
me out here.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I didn’t tell you that, did I?” returned Mrs.
Tucker ingenuously. “I just wanted to tell you that,
now that we’re stock-holders to a reasonable amount—Ralph
retained a few shares, you know, and holds a
proxy for mine—we look at the matter from an entirely
different viewpoint, and we think that every
reasonable precaution should be taken to avoid poor
risks, as you call them. We are highly gratified by
the evidence of caution that has inadvertently come
under our notice, even if there was an incidental error
that baffled human foresight.”
</p>
<p>
The sudden and startling changes of position by
this young woman were too much for both Murray and
the doctor; they could only look at her in amazement
as she calmly commended their course.
</p>
<p>
“You have brought us all this distance to tell us
that!” ejaculated Murray at last.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s worth the trip!” he announced, as he recalled
the events of the last year.
</p>
<p>
Then Tucker appeared, big, strong, bronzed,
hearty, and shook hands with them. Never a weakling
in appearance, his year of outdoor life had made him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
the embodiment of health. He beamed upon his guests
with hearty good nature as he gave them each a grip
that made them wince. His wife regarded him critically
for a moment.
</p>

“Poor Ralph!” she said mischievously, and then she
hastily assured them that this was really the last of

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span><a name='c7' id='c7'></a>AN INCIDENTAL FAILURE</h2>
<p>
Adolph Schlimmer’s wink was of the self-satisfied
variety that plainly says to the person at whom it is
directed, “They’re mostly fools in this world—except
you and me, and I’m not quite sure about you.”
Adolph Schlimmer was a small man, but he thought
he had enough worldly wisdom and sharpness for a
giant. “You bet you, I don’t get fooled very much,”
he boasted.
</p>
<p>
Just now his wink was directed at Carroll Brown,
an insurance solicitor.
</p>
<p>
“How much iss there in it for you?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I get my commission, of course,” replied
Brown.
</p>
<p>
“Sure, sure,”—and again Adolph winked. “You
don’t need it all, maybe.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Brown with disconcerting frankness.
“I’m entitled to what I earn.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, sure,” admitted Adolph, somewhat annoyed.
“It’s vorth something to you to make the money, ain’t
it, yes? I gif you the chance. It might be vorth
something to me, perhaps, maybe.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you want me to divide my commission with
you,” exclaimed Brown, “we might as well quit talking
right here. It would cost me my job, if anybody
found it out.”
</p>
<p>
“Who iss to find it out? I bet you, if people could
find out things, we’d haf more people in jail than out.
Some big men, vorth millions, would haf to live a
century to serf their time out. The boss discharges
hiss clerk for doin’ what he iss doin’ himself.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s against the law,” argued Brown. “It’s a
rebate on premiums and is prohibited.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, sure,” conceded Adolph again. “But you
got to do something to make business, ain’t it? I gif
premiums and I get discounts. There don’t nobody
fool me very much.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m taking no chances with either my job
or the law,” announced Brown, “even if I wanted to
sacrifice part of my legitimate commission. I’m offering
you a policy in a first-class company on the same
terms that we give them to all others, and that’s the
best I can do. If you’re looking for an advantage
over your neighbors, you’ll have to go elsewhere. The
very first rule of straight business is to treat all alike.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure it iss,” returned Adolph. “Look at the railroads
and the big shippers.” Again he winked wisely.
“I bet you, your boss ain’t such a fool as you. Make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
the big money when you can, but don’t run avay
from the little money. I gif you a chance for the
little money because I’m smart; some other feller let
you haf it all because he issn’t.”
</p>
<p>
Therein lay the measure of Adolph. It was beyond
his comprehension that any man should treat all
fairly: some one surely was “on the inside,” and his
first thought in any transaction was to make a quiet
“deal” with some interested party that would give
him a trifling advantage over others. He was shrewd
in a small and near-sighted way, and he had an idea
that all men, except fools, looked at things as he did.
He believed there was “graft” in everything. That
being the case, it was the duty of a sharp man to get
a share of it, even if, as in this instance, it only
lessened his own expense somewhat. So Adolph
Schlimmer went to see Brown’s boss, who happened
to be Dave Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I get me some insurance,” he announced.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” returned Murray agreeably. “You
look like a good risk.”
</p>
<p>
“Risk?” repeated Adolph. “No, <em>nein</em>. I’m a sure
thing.”
</p>
<p>
Murray laughed.
</p>
<p>
“That’s bad,” he said banteringly. “Sure things
are what men go broke on in this world; they’re the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
biggest risks of all.” Then, explanatorily: “I mean
you seem to be in good physical condition, so that our
physician is likely to pass you.”
</p>
<p>
“You bet you,” returned Adolph, “but it’s my vife
what counts. If I die, I leaf her the money; if she
die, she leaf me nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you want to get a policy on your wife’s life,”
said Murray thoughtfully, not favorably impressed
with the other’s commercial tone. “How much?”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Zwei</em> t’ousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“Not very much,” commented Murray. “A man
of sense would prefer a good wife to two thousand
dollars any day. Is she a worker?”
</p>
<p>
“You bet you, yes,” replied Adolph earnestly. “If
she die, I looss money on her at that price. I figger
it all out. She safe me the wages uf a clerk and a
cook and some other things. I count up what she
safe me and what she cost me and she’s vorth fifteen
dollars a week easy in work and ten dollars a week
in saving. I can’t afford to looss that. I insure the
store and the stock, and now I insure this. I watch
out for myself pretty close.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was both disgusted and amused. Such a
character as this was new to his experience, but the
risk might be, and probably was, a perfectly good
and legitimate one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, you bring your wife in,” he said after a
moment of thought, “and I’ll talk to her.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” said Adolph. Then he winked in his wise
way. “I safe you the commission. What iss there
in it for me?”
</p>
<p>
“What?” exclaimed Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I haf a talk with Brown,” explained Adolph. “It’s
vorth something to him to get the business, but he
don’t make it vorth nothing to me to give it.”
</p>
<p>
“If he did we’d discharge him.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, sure,” returned the imperturbable Adolph.
“We got to watch the boys or there won’t be nothing
left for us. So I safe the commission for you. What
iss there in it for me?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a damn thing!”
</p>
<p>
“You play it that way with the fool,” advised
Adolph complacently. “It’s a bully bluff for the
feller that don’t know how things was done in business.
Then we go splits, yes?”
</p>
<p>
The ignorance and effrontery of the man so amazed
Murray that he forgot his indignation for a moment
and undertook to explain.
</p>
<p>
“There is no commission on business that comes to
the office,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Sure!” laughed Adolph, again resorting to that
sagacious wink. “You let the company make it, yes?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
I stay home, you send man to tell me get insured, I
say yes, man get paid—ain’t it so? I come here to
get insured, and you give that man’s pay to the company,
the men vorth millions—oh, yes, sure!” Adolph
laughed at the absurdity of the thing. “Iss there
anything in my eye?” he asked suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“You sit down there!” ordered Murray, for Adolph
was now leaning familiarly over Murray’s desk. “I
ought to kick you out, but I’m going to tell you a few
things. Sit down and keep still. I’m several sizes
bigger than you are and it’s my turn.” Murray
spoke so aggressively that Adolph promptly returned
to his seat. “Now, to begin with, you make a mistake
in judging everybody else by yourself; there
are a lot of decent people in this world. A good many
may worship the almighty dollar, and that’s bad
enough, but God help the few who get down to worshiping
the almighty cent. A good many keep a
lookout for graft, but you are the first one I ever saw
who seemed to think everybody was crooked.”
</p>
<p>
“No, <em>nein</em>; only business—”
</p>
<p>
“Keep still! You insult everybody you try to do
business with by acting on the assumption that he is
in your class. You have absorbed some of the tricky
commercialism that is prevalent these days, and you’ve
got the idea that there isn’t anything else—not even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
common sense. You would break the law for a trifle.
What you propose is morally wrong, but we won’t discuss
that, because you can’t understand it.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like—”
</p>
<p>
“Keep still! I’m doing you a favor, but I’ve got
to tell you first what a libel you are on the average
human being. The law that you want to break was
made for the protection of just such financially insignificant
people as you. It prohibits giving rebates
in any form on insurance premiums and provides that
the acceptance of such a rebate by the policy-holder
shall invalidate his policy, and that the giving of
such a rebate by a company or any of its agents shall
subject the company to a fine. Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure; but who iss to know?”
</p>
<p>
Murray was discouraged, but he had set out to
drive a lesson home to this dull-witted fellow who
thought he was smart, and he valiantly held to his
task. He could feel nothing but contempt for the
man, but he had become rather interested in convincing
him how foolish he was. Besides, Murray was a
bitter opponent of the rebate evil in all lines of business—every
one knows how it fosters monopoly—and
he attacked it whenever and wherever he could.
</p>
<p>
“If rebates on insurance premiums were not unlawful,”
he asked, “do you think people of your kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
are the ones who would get them? Well, hardly. The
millionaires, the rich men, the men who take out the
big policies, would get them, and you little fellows
would pay the full price, just as you do wherever
else the rebate evil exists. This law was made to
protect you, and you want to break it down. Well, I
suppose there are others just as bad. The men for
whose benefit a law is made frequently insist upon
playing with it until they drop it and break it, and
then they wonder why the splinters won’t do them
as much good as the original law.” Having warmed
up to a subject that interested him, Murray was talking
for himself now. Adolph could understand in a
general way what he meant, but many of the remarks
were entirely beyond his comprehension. “Look at it
in another way,” Murray went on. “As a speculation,
the insurance rebate is a mistake. The man who gets
or accepts a rebate is taking a risk. ‘Well,’ he argues,
‘so is the man who buys wheat or stocks or undeveloped
real estate of problematical future value.’ Quite right;
but when you speculate you want to be sure that your
probable or possible profits bear a fair proportion to
the risk and your possible losses. It’s all right to make
a secured loan of one thousand dollars at five per cent.,
but when you put your thousand into a scheme where
there is a chance of losing every cent of it, you also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
want a chance of making a good deal more than the
legal rate of interest. Russell Sage is said to look
as closely after the small profits as the large, but
Russell would shy away from an investment—a real
safe <em>investment</em>—that promised only a ten cent profit
on five dollars; and if it were a <em>speculation</em>, where he
might lose the whole five, he would want to see a possibility
of winning at least half as much. The man
who accepts an insurance premium rebate is going into
a speculation—a flimsy, cheap speculation, with a
chance of loss so entirely out of proportion to the
slight advantage he gains over other policy-holders
that no man with a grain of sense would consider
it for a moment. To secure a discount on his premium
he risks his whole policy. Why, in your case
you would put a two-thousand-dollar policy in danger
to save a few miserable dollars. It isn’t cleverness, it
isn’t shrewdness, it isn’t business, it isn’t sense; it isn’t
anything but damn foolishness. Do you understand?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” answered Adolph. “If we iss found out, I
looss the policy and you looss a fine. We both looss.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it exactly.”
</p>
<p>
“Vell, if we both looss by telling, who iss going to
find it out?” demanded Adolph triumphantly. “You
bet you, I take the chance. Go ahead with her.”
</p>
<p>
Murray leaned wearily back in his chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’d better get out of here,” he said. “This company
wouldn’t issue a policy in which you had any
sort of interest on any terms. I was curious to discover
if I could not stir up just a glimmer of business
sense in you, and my curiosity is satisfied. You seem
to me like a man who would risk all his money to win
a fly-speck, if he thought he was going to win it by
some underhand deal. Get out as quick as you can!
But I tell you again, don’t fool with rebates!”
</p>
<p>
Adolph stopped in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“You got to haf the whole commission, yes?” he
remarked with accusing bitterness. “I take you for
a hog.”
</p>
<p>
Then he disappeared very suddenly, for he feared
Murray would pursue.
</p>
<p>
Here again was the measure of Adolph. In spite
of Murray’s explanation, he could see nothing except
a chance to win by saving a part of the commission.
He could not comprehend that he was running any
unusual risk or doing anything that another would
not do, if the other had the sense to see the chance.
In fact, he was fully convinced in his own mind that
Murray was merely talking for effect and really desired
the whole commission for himself. This made
him the more determined to gain this small advantage
for himself—partly because his little business world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
was made up of such devious methods, and partly because
it would be an evidence of his own cleverness.
</p>
<p>
Now, occasionally a solicitor for a company of high
standing, acting on his own responsibility, will divide
his commission in order to get some one to take out
a policy. If he is trying to make a record, the temptation
is considerable. If the policy is large, his half
of this commission may be more than his whole commission
in most other cases. He does this secretly, but
he is inviting three kinds of trouble: his own discharge,
a fine for his company, and a loss for the
policy-holder. These three things will follow discovery,
but he takes the chance. And there are irresponsible
or unscrupulous companies or agencies (so
it is said) that will tacitly approve such a course in
some instances, taking the necessary risk in order to
get business. Of course, no first-class or reliable company
will sanction or even tolerate such methods.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Adolph, the shrewd fool, finally found
the man for whom he was searching. A man may
nearly always find trouble if he searches for it industriously,
and Adolph was industrious. Unfortunately
for him, however, he treated several other solicitors
to his knowing wink before he met the one who agreed
to his proposition, and, when it was learned that
Adolph was taking out a policy on his wife’s life, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
were quick to reach conclusions. But it was none of
their business, and they said nothing. What they
knew merely made it easier to prove the case, if the
question should ever arise. The solicitor who finally
entered into the deal was one who had done the same
thing before. He was “broke” a good part of the time,
and, when in that condition, he did not question
closely the ethics of any proposition that promised
an early, even though small, cash return. He was an
outcast among such of the many conscientious men of
the fraternity as knew him, but the local agent of the
company that employed him was not particular, and
there were rumors that the company itself might have
been more strict.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, Adolph got the policy he wanted. His
wife was disposed to object at first, for she had not
been consulted until Adolph had made his bargain.
There was no use, he argued, in telling her about it
until he knew what he was going to do.
</p>
<p>
“I buy you a policy,” he finally told her in the
tone that a man—another man—might tell his wife
he would buy her a sealskin coat.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“It pays <em>zwei</em> t’ousand dollars,” he explained.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Schlimmer was not enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>
“When?” she asked.
</p>
<div class='figcenter' style='padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<a name='i004' id='i004'></a>
<img src="images/illus-160.jpg" alt="“What’s the use to me?” she persisted" title=""/><br />
<span class='caption'>“What’s the use to me?” she persisted</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>
“When you are in the grafe,” he answered after a
pause.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the use to me?” she persisted.
</p>
<p>
“My dear,” he said, with such gallantry as he
could command, “it shows what you iss vorth.”
</p>
<p>
Somehow, she was not flattered. She was a good
wife, who worked hard, and she herself thought she
was worth it, but she was selfish enough to think she
ought to realize on her own value.
</p>
<p>
“No, <em>nein</em>,” he argued, “it ain’t the vay it’s done.
You got yourself, ain’t it, yes? When you ain’t got
yourself, you ain’t here, but I am. You don’t looss
yourself when you die, but I looss you, and you’re
vorth a lot.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s other women,” she retorted.
</p>
<p>
“But they ain’t vorth what you are by <em>zwei</em>
t’ousand dollars,” he insisted, and this delicate bit of
flattery won the day. After all, it made no difference
to her. She rebelled a little at going to the insurance
office to be examined, however.
</p>
<p>
“You tell ’em I’m all right,” she urged. “You
know.”
</p>
<p>
But a new gown—a cheap one—gained this point,
and she went.
</p>
<p>
Adolph prided himself very much on this stroke of
business. His great aim in life was to pay a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
less than the market price for everything, and he was
never convinced that he was really doing this unless
the deal had to be carried out in some underhand
way. When he could buy for less than others he was
making so much more money, and it was his experience
that the biggest profit lay in shady transactions.
In others he had made, or saved, much more than
in this, but the difficulties he encountered in this instance
convinced him that it was an especially notable
achievement. He was proud of his success.
</p>
<p>
“You bet you, they don’t fool me very much,” he
asserted frequently.
</p>
<p>
And, in time, he told how clever he was. Not at
first, however; he was very cautious at first, for Murray’s
words had made an impression on him. But,
after he had paid a few premiums, the lapse of time
gave him a feeling of security, and one day, in boasting
of his business shrewdness, he mentioned that he
was even sharp enough to get life insurance at a bargain.
After that, it was easier to speak of it again,
and he finally told the story. The news spread in his
own little circle. It was quite a feat, and he was held
to have demonstrated remarkable cleverness. When
another told of some sharp business deal, some one
would remark, “Yes, that was clever, but you never
got life insurance at a bargain.” And, in the course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
of time—six months or more from the time the story
was first breathed—it came to the ears of one Daniel
Grady. This was unfortunate, for Daniel at once
jumped to the conclusion that he had been cheated.
Daniel had a small policy in the same company, and
this policy was costing him the full premium without
rebate of any kind from any insurance solicitor or
anybody else. Daniel did not like this, and neither
did he like Adolph; in fact, he would have been willing
to pay a little higher premium for the privilege
of making trouble for Adolph. Failing that, Daniel
would like to get on even terms with him.
</p>
<p>
“It’s th’ divil iv a note,” said Daniel, “that I
sh’u’d be payin’ more than that little shrimp, an’ me
only thryin’ to take care iv Maggie an’ th’ childhern.
I’ll go down to th’ office an’ push th’ face iv th’ man
in if he don’t give me th’ same rate, I will so.”
</p>
<p>
But Daniel wisely did nothing of the kind, for he
recalled that there were a number of clerks in the
office and a police station not far away, and he had
no wish to add a fine to his expenses. Instead, after
pondering the matter a few weeks and growing steadily
more indignant, he went to see a little lawyer who
had an office over a saloon, next to a justice of the
peace. Daniel planned only to get his premiums reduced,
but the lawyer saw other opportunities.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a great chance,” said the lawyer. “You’re
a policy-holder—”
</p>
<p>
“Who says so?” demanded Daniel, for this sounded
to him like an accusation.
</p>
<p>
“I mean,” explained the lawyer, “that you are
insured in the company.”
</p>
<p>
“What iv it?” asked Daniel.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the other policy-holders are the ones discriminated
against in a case like this,” said the lawyer,
“and any one of them can file a complaint.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not the kind iv a man to do much complainin’,”
declared Daniel. “I niver see that it did much good.
If I c’u’d give Schlimmer a bad turn—”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it; that’s it exactly. You can knock his insurance
sky-high and get some money yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“Say that wanst more,” urged Daniel. “Me hearin’
seems to be playin’ thricks.”
</p>
<p>
“The law,” said the lawyer slowly, “fines a company
for doing that—”
</p>
<p>
“How much?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to look it up. Pretty stiff fine, though,
and the informer—”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like th’ word.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, the man who makes the complaint gets half
the fine. Do you understand that? Let me take charge
of the matter for you, and we’ll divide the money.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
“Will it hurt me own insurance?” asked Daniel.
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not lukkin’ to l’ave Maggie an’ th’ childhern
without money whin I die, jist to land a dollar-twinty
f’r me own pocket now. That’s a Schlimmer thrick.”
</p>
<p>
“Your insurance will be just as good as it ever
was,” the lawyer asserted.
</p>
<p>
“Will there be twinty dollars in it f’r me?” Daniel
persisted.
</p>
<p>
“There’ll be a good deal more than that—exactly
how much I can’t say.”
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead,” instructed Daniel. “Put the little divil
through.”
</p>
<p>
The lawyer investigated and found his task comparatively
easy, for Adolph had now personally told
the story to several people. Indeed, by the exercise
of a little ingenuity, the lawyer got him to tell it to
him. Then he acted.
</p>
<p>
When the news reached the local agency of the
company there was no indecision as to what should be
done. Unnecessary publicity in a matter of that kind
was the very last thing sought. The solicitor was
called in, put on the rack, and promptly confessed.
Then he was discharged without further questioning.
Perhaps the local agent was afraid he might learn of
other similar instances if he pressed the matter too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
far, and he was quite content to remain in ignorance
of anything else of that nature, so long as the public
also remained in ignorance. The company promptly
acknowledged its fault, showed that it had cleared itself
morally by discharging the offending agent, and
proceeded to clear itself legally by paying the necessary
fine.
</p>
<p>
When the news came to Adolph, however, there
was wailing prolonged, for his policy was annulled.
</p>
<p>
“I bet you,” said Adolph, “that feller Murray put
up the job. He iss a great hog; he iss like those
mono<em>pol</em>ists that puts smaller people out of business
and gobbles it all.”
</p>
<p>
Then Adolph got a pencil and a sheet of paper
and began to figure his losses.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Zwei</em> t’ousand dollar insurance,” he groaned, “and
maybe she wouldn’t lif long. And I gif her a
dress, too—a new dress. <em>Ach, Himmel!</em> it’s hard
when a man’s vife beats him. A new dress for nothing
at all but to looss money. That law iss a shame. It
iss a—what you call it?—restriction of business.”
</p>
<p>
Thereafter, for some time, the sight of the new
gown would make Adolph morose and gloomy, and
his friends found him unusually modest and unobtrusive.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a name='c8' id='c8'></a>AN INCIDENTAL SCHEME</h2>
<p>
There came to Dave Murray one day a young man
who was looking for a job. He was a bright young
fellow and seemed to be very earnest.
</p>
<p>
“I have been a clerk,” he explained, “but there is
little prospect for the future where I am now, and
I want to get something that has some promise in it.
In fact, I must do so. I am making barely enough
to support my mother and myself, and I may want
to marry, you know.”
</p>
<p>
Murray readily admitted that young men frequently
were attacked by the matrimonial bacillus and
that, there being no sure antidote, the disease had to
run its course. “Which is a good thing for the world,”
he added, “so you are quite right to prepare yourself
for the attack. But are you sure that insurance is
your field?”
</p>
<p>
“I have given the subject a good deal of thought,”
was the reply, “and insurance interests me.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a good sign,” commented Murray. “Success
is for the man who is interested in his work, and
not merely in the financial results of that work.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I want to make money, too,” said the young
man frankly.
</p>
<p>
“We all do,” returned Murray, “but the man who
has no other aim than that would better stick to business
and let the professions alone. Life insurance has
become a profession, like banking. Time was when
anybody with money could be a banker, but now it is
conceded to require special gifts and a special training.
I place life insurance right up in the front rank
of the professions, for it is semi-philanthropic. We
are not in it for our health, of course, but, if we are
conscientious and earnest, we may reasonably flatter
ourselves that we are doing a vast amount of good
in line with our work. The life insurance solicitor
has been the butt of many jokes. Perhaps he himself
has been responsible for this, but times have changed
and so have methods. If I ever caught one of my
men slipping into an office with an apologetic air, like
a second-rate book-canvasser, I’d discharge him on the
spot. The insurance solicitor of to-day wants to consider
himself a business man with a business proposition
to make; he must have self-respect and show it.
The best men plan their work carefully, do not attempt
to hurry matters, and usually meet those that
they expect to interest in their proposition by appointment,
instead of trying to force the thing upon them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
by pure nerve. When a fellow becomes a nuisance
he is hurting himself, his company and all others in
his line. Do you still think insurance the line for
you?”
</p>
<p>
“I can begin,” said the young man, by way of reply,
“with an application from my present employer. I’ve
been talking insurance to him for practice, and he has
agreed to take out a policy. He’s a pretty good fellow.
He says I’m worth more than he can afford to
pay me and he wants to help me along.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you’re all right,” laughed Murray. “At
any rate, you impress me as being the kind of man I
want. Leave your references and come in again tomorrow.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was unusually particular as to the character
of the men he employed. It was not enough
for him that a man could get business, but he had his
own ideas as to the way business should be secured.
Absolute integrity and the most painstaking care to
state a proposition fairly, without exaggeration, were
points upon which he insisted.
</p>
<p>
“A dissatisfied policy-holder,” he said, “is a dead
weight to carry; a satisfied policy-holder is an advertisement.
If a man finds he is getting a little more
than he expected, he is so much better pleased; if he
finds he is getting a little less, he feels he has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
tricked. Insurance is a good enough proposition, so
that you don’t have to gild it.”
</p>
<p>
Murray himself, in his younger days, had once secured
an application for a large policy by refusing
to expatiate on the merits of the particular form of
insurance he was advocating.
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s hear what a beautiful thing it is,” the
man had said.
</p>
<p>
“My dear sir,” Murray had replied, “it is a straight
business proposition, with no frills or twists of any
kind. You have the facts and the figures. If you,
with your business training, can’t see the merit of it,
it would be a waste of time for me to attempt any
elucidation. I have not the egotism to think I can
<em>talk</em> you into taking out a policy. As a matter of
fact, this proposition doesn’t need any argument, and
it would be a reflection on the plain merit of the proposition
for me to attempt one.”
</p>
<p>
Different methods for different men. This man
never before had seen an insurance solicitor who would
not talk for an hour, if he had the chance, and he was
impressed and pleased. This was business,—straight
business and nothing else. He straightway took out a
large policy.
</p>
<p>
Something of this Murray told the young man when
he came back the next day, for he was anxious to impress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
upon him the fact that life insurance was not
like a mining scheme, which has to be painted with all
the glories of the sunset in order to float the stock,
and that the man who overstated his case would inevitably
suffer from the reaction.
</p>
<p>
Murray had been favorably impressed with the
young man—Max Mays was the name he gave—and
the employer of Mays had spoken well of him. He
was rather a peculiar fellow, according to the employer—always
busy with figures or financial stories
and seemingly deeply interested in the details of
the large business affairs that were discussed in the
newspapers and the magazines. Aside from this,
he was about like the average clerk who hopes for
and seeks better opportunities, and meanwhile
makes the best of what he has—reasonably industrious
and yet far from forsaking the pleasures of this
life.
</p>
<p>
All in all, Mays seemed like good material from
which to make a life insurance man, and the fact
that he did not propose to desert his present employer
without notice was in his favor. Possibly the fact
that he was getting his first commission through the
latter had something to do with this, but, anyhow, he
planned to continue where he was until a successor
had been secured; and too many young men, contemplating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
such a change, would have let their enthusiasm
lead them to quit without notice when they
found the new place open to them. This is mentioned
merely as one of the things that led Murray to think
he had secured a thoroughly conscientious, as well as
an ambitious, employee.
</p>
<p>
When he finally reported for duty Murray gave him
certain general instructions, principal among which
was this: “Never make a statement that will require
explanation or modification later. Any time you decide
that the proposition you are making is not good
enough to stand squarely on its merits, without exaggeration
or deception, direct or inferential, come
into the office and resign. Any time you find yourself
saying anything that you yourself do not believe implicitly,
it is time for you to quit. When you have
to explain what you really meant by some certain
statement, you are creating doubt and distrust, for
the unadulterated truth, of course, does not have to be
explained.”
</p>
<p>
For a time Murray watched Mays rather closely—not
in the expectation of finding anything wrong, but
rather with the idea of giving him helpful suggestions—but
the young man seemed to be unusually capable
and unusually successful for a beginner. He seemed
to be working a comparatively new field—a field that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
turned up no large policies but that seemed to be prolific
of small ones. This, however, was quite natural.
Every new man works first among those he happens
to know, and Mays was doing business with his old
associates. In time, Murray ceased to give him any
particular attention, except to note the regularity
with which he turned in applications for small policies,
and there probably would have been no deviation from
the customary routine had it not been for an unexpected
and apparently trivial incident.
</p>
<p>
An application for a small policy had come in
through one of the other solicitors. Mays happened
to be in the office when the applicant called for his
physical examination, but they exchanged no greetings.
Apparently they were strangers. Yet Mays
slipped out into the hall and intercepted the other
as he came from the doctor’s office. Murray, emerging
suddenly from his own room, saw them talking together
and caught this question and answer:
</p>
<p>
“Is it all right?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course. I’m a bully good risk, as you call it.”
</p>
<p>
Then, seeing Murray, they hastily separated and
went their ways.
</p>
<p>
Now, why should a friend of Mays apply for insurance
through another solicitor? Well, he might
have been ignorant, when he made his application, of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
the fact that Mays was in the insurance business. But
why did they give no sign of recognition when they
met in the main office? It was quite natural that
Mays should be anxious to learn how his friend came
out with the physician, but why should he sneak out
into the hall to ask the question?
</p>
<p>
Any evidence of secrecy and underhand work always
annoyed Murray. He did not like this, although he
could see nothing in it to cause him any anxiety.
Nevertheless, he looked up the papers of the man who
had just been examined and found that his name was
John Tainter and that he lived near Mays. He was
a good risk, however, and he got his policy. There
was no earthly reason why it should be refused. But
Murray watched Mays more carefully and gave painstaking
attention to the risks he brought in.
</p>
<p>
The applicants were generally small tradesmen—usually
foreigners—but there was nothing in
the least suspicious in any case. Indeed, it was
difficult to see how there could be anything
wrong, for the safeguards made it practically impossible
for a mere solicitor to put up any successful
scheme to beat the company, and certainly
it would not be tried with any trifling policy. But
it annoyed Murray to find that a man he had believed
so frank and straightforward was tricky, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
could not, try as he would, find any reason for this
trickiness.
</p>
<p>
Then, one day, while he was waiting in a hotel office
for his card to be taken up to the room of a man with
whom he had some business, he heard a strangely
familiar voice near him making a strangely familiar
assertion.
</p>
<p>
“You bet you, they don’t fool me very much,” said
the voice.
</p>
<p>
Murray turned to see who it was, but a big square
column was in the way. Murray’s chair was backed
up to one side of this, and the speaker was on the
other.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t just place that voice,” mused Murray, “but
I have heard it somewhere.” There was silence for an
instant.
</p>
<p>
“It’s going to be vorth something, ain’t it, yes?”
inquired the voice at last.
</p>
<p>
“It looks like a big thing and no mistake,” was the
reply.
</p>
<p>
“By George!” muttered Murray, “it’s that Adolph
Schlimmer who tried to get a rebate on his policy, and
the fellow with him is Max Mays.”
</p>
<p>
Just then word came that Murray’s man would see
him, and he had to leave. He was careful, however,
to keep the column between him and the two he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
found in conversation. It was just as well not to
let them know of his presence, for he preferred not
to have their suspicions aroused.
</p>
<p>
There was now little doubt in his mind that some
scheme was being worked out. But what? What
could these two men, neither of whom was versed in
the theory and details of life insurance, do that would
be in any way hurtful to the company or advantageous
to them? Of course, it was only a surmise that their
confidential business concerned him in any way, but
association with Schlimmer would be sufficient to make
Murray uneasy about any of his men, and the strange
action of Mays in the Tainter matter added to his
uneasiness.
</p>
<p>
His first move was to investigate Mays thoroughly,
and, to his astonishment, he discovered that, far from
having a mother to support, Mays was living with a
married brother and had no one to look after but
himself. He had told the truth about his business
record, but he had lied about his personal responsibilities.
That lie had been an artistic one, however, for
it had helped materially to get him a position with
Murray.
</p>
<p>
Further investigation showed that there was a
light-headed, frivolous young girl, to whom he
was devoted and with whom he attended Saturday-night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
dances in various public halls, but it had to be
admitted, to his credit, that he never let these interfere
with business and was always on hand with a
clear head. At the same time, it threw an entirely
new light on his character, and showed him to be not
at all the sort of fellow his business record had indicated.
</p>
<p>
Murray was tempted to discharge him at once, but
he refrained for two reasons: first, his action would
be dictated by his own disappointment in the man
rather than by anything he knew that was definitely
derogatory, aside from his falsehood about his mother;
second, he wanted a chance to investigate further the
association with Schlimmer, and the only way to do
this was to pretend to be entirely unsuspicious and
entirely satisfied. If there was any kind of scheme
that could be put up by two such men, he was interested
in finding it out, especially if they had already
taken any action. Until the thing was clear, he wished
to have Mays within reach.
</p>
<p>
Mays was shadowed for a few days, but nothing was
learned except that he unquestionably had business
relations with the unscrupulous Schlimmer, and that
they occasionally met in the office of a lawyer in that
district.
</p>
<p>
“A lawyer!” mused Murray. “Now, what the devil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
do they need of a lawyer? I can’t see where he comes
in.”
</p>
<p>
“Tainter was with them once,” replied the
“shadow.”
</p>
<p>
“I certainly never had anything puzzle me like
this,” remarked Murray. “The separate incidents
are so trifling that it seems absurd to attach any importance
to them, and yet, taking them all together,
I am convinced there is something wrong. I’d like
to hear what they have to say to each other.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the shadow, “can be easily arranged,
for they are to meet next Sunday afternoon, and I
can get the janitor easily to let us into the adjoining
office.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be there,” said Murray.
</p>
<p>
Now, Murray, in spite of his good nature, was a
dignified man, but he knew when to sacrifice his dignity.
He was an “office man,” but he rather enjoyed
an excuse for getting outside and occupying himself
in some unusual way. In fact, Murray had the making
of a “strenuous” man in him, if fate had not decreed
that he should devote his energies to the less exciting
task of directing the destinies of a life insurance
agency. So he rather enjoyed the mild excitement of
getting into the adjoining office unobserved and lying
prone on his stomach to get his ear close to the crack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
under the door. But the reward was not great. The
lawyer—a big blustering fellow—was there, and so
were Schlimmer, Tainter and Mays, but the meeting
seemed to be one for jubilation rather than for planning.
</p>
<p>
“I got the papers all ready,” said the lawyer.
“Sign ’em, Tainter, and then we’re ready to go ahead
the moment Mays gives the word. We want to land
all we can.”
</p>
<p>
And that was the only business transacted. The
rest of the time was given to gloating over some scheme
that was not put in words.
</p>
<p>
“You bet you, I make that Murray sit up and take
notice, yes?” remarked Schlimmer. “I gif him his
chance once and I get the vorst of it, but I even up
now.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s great,” commented the lawyer. “You’ve got
a great head on you, Schlimmer. Not one man in a
thousand would have thought of it. We’ll all even up,
but they would have been mighty suspicious if I had
let Tainter’s application go in through Mays. That’s
where you get the advantage of having a lawyer in
the deal.”
</p>
<p>
And more to the same effect, but no definite explanation
of the scheme.
</p>
<p>
Murray was at his office unusually early Monday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
morning, and the first thing he did was to have a
clerk look up the Schlimmer case. Some company, he
knew, had got into trouble over a Schlimmer policy,
and he wanted to know all about it. He learned that
Schlimmer had taken out a policy on his wife’s life,
had demanded and secured a rebate from the solicitor,
and that another policy-holder had taken action that
resulted in nullifying the policy and imposing a fine
on the company.
</p>
<p>
“I think I understand it now,” mused Murray, “but
it looks to me as if pretty prompt action might be
necessary.”
</p>
<p>
All doubt, all hesitation had disappeared. Murray
was wide awake and active. He called in his private
messenger.
</p>
<p>
“When Mr. Mays reports,” he said, “he is to wait
until I have had a talk with him before going out. I
shall send for him when I am ready.” Then, giving
the boy a slip of paper with a name and an address on
it, “I want to see that man here at once. Take a cab
and bring him. Tell him the validity of his life insurance
depends upon it.”
</p>
<p>
While the boy was gone, Murray slipped out himself,
and, when he returned, a stranger accompanied
him. The stranger was secreted in a room adjoining,
and then Murray took up the routine of his regular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
work. The only interruption came when a clerk informed
him that Mays was waiting.
</p>
<p>
“Let him wait,” said Murray. “I’m not quite ready
for him yet. If he tries to leave, jump on his back
and hold him.”
</p>
<p>
After a time the messenger returned with the man
for whom he had been sent, and Murray immediately
took him into his private office and shut the door.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Leckster,” he said abruptly, “how much of a
rebate did Mays give you on the policy you took out
with us?”
</p>
<p>
Leckster was plainly mystified and frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Out with it!” commanded Murray. “Your policy
isn’t worth the paper it’s written on unless the matter
is straightened out mighty quick. How much was the
rebate?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand,” said Leckster, already nearly
terror-stricken.
</p>
<p>
“How much of his commission did he give to you to
get you to take out a policy?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he give me a half.”
</p>
<p>
“Leckster,” said Murray, “that was against the law.
If any other policy-holder hears of it and wants to go
into court, he can nullify your policy and get half
of the fine that will be assessed against us for the act
of our agent. If you want to make your policy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
unassailable, you must refund that rebate. Now, go
home and think it over.”
</p>
<p>
Then he sent word to Mays that he was ready to
see him.
</p>
<p>
“Mays,” he said abruptly, “what was your
scheme?”
</p>
<p>
“Sir!” exclaimed Mays.
</p>
<p>
“What was your scheme?”
</p>
<p>
“Surely you must be joking, sir,” protested Mays.
“I have no scheme.”
</p>
<p>
“Why did Tainter,” replied Murray in deliberate
tones, “a friend of yours, put in his application
through another solicitor?”
</p>
<p>
“He didn’t know I was in the insurance business until
he came up here to be examined.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why did you fail to recognize each other
until you got out in the hall where you thought you
were unobserved?”
</p>
<p>
Mays did not even hesitate. Evidently he had prepared
himself for this.
</p>
<p>
“Another man had got his application,” he said,
“and I was afraid it would look as if I were trying
to interfere in some way. I did nod to him, but very
likely it wasn’t noticed.”
</p>
<p>
“What are your relations with Schlimmer?” persisted
Murray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I got into a little business deal with him, for
which I am sincerely sorry. I’m trying to get out
now.”
</p>
<p>
“Insurance?” asked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir; it had nothing whatever to do with insurance.”
</p>
<p>
Murray was thoughtful and silent for several minutes.
</p>
<p>
“Mays,” he said at last, speaking slowly, “I don’t
know whether you’re worth saving or not. You’ve
got in with a bad crowd and you’re mixed up in a bad
deal. But you impressed me favorably when you
came here, and I think you are capable of being legitimately
successful. Of course, you lied to me about
your mother—”
</p>
<p>
“I was very anxious for the job, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I quite appreciate that, although your motive for
wanting the job will hardly bear close scrutiny. Still,
you are young and I am anxious to give you another
chance. Now, tell me the whole story.”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing to tell, sir,” Mays replied with
an ingenuous air. “Your words and insinuations are
a deep mystery to me.”
</p>
<p>
“Think again,” advised Murray. “I know the
story pretty well myself.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall be glad to have you tell it, sir,” said Mays.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
“Your earnestness leads me to think it must be interesting.”
</p>
<p>
“If I tell it,” said Murray, “it removes your last
chance of escaping any of the consequences.”
</p>
<p>
“Go ahead,” said Mays.
</p>
<p>
At least, he had magnificent nerve.
</p>
<p>
“Schlimmer,” said Murray, fixing his eyes sharply
on Mays, “was once mixed up in a little trouble over
rebates, which are unlawful. He tried to get me to
give him a rebate on a policy, but I refused, and he
seems to have got the idea that I was directly responsible
for the failure of his scheme elsewhere. He
learned, however, that the informer gets half of the
fine assessed against the company in each case, but
that only another policy-holder is empowered to make
the necessary complaint. It occurred to Schlimmer
that, if he could find enough rebate cases, there would
be a good bit of money in it on the division of the fines.
Being a man of low cunning, it occurred to Schlimmer
that these cases might be manufactured, if he could
get hold of a complaisant insurance solicitor, for the
company is held responsible for the act of the agent,
and the easiest way to get hold of a complaisant
solicitor was to make one. So he went to a young man
who was absorbed in the study of tricky finance and
who couldn’t see why he couldn’t do that sort of thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
himself, and the young man got a job in this office.
The young man, Max Mays by name, immediately
began preparing rebate cases for future use. He
worked among a class of people who knew little of
insurance or insurance laws and who are in the habit
of figuring very closely, and this rebate proposition
looked pretty good to them.
</p>
<p>
“Next, Schlimmer and Mays got a lawyer into the
scheme, because they would need him when it came
to the later proceedings, and they further prepared
for their <em>coup</em> by having a confederate, named Tainter,
take out a policy in the company, so that he would be
in a position to make the necessary complaint. In
order to avert suspicion, when the time for action
came, Tainter applied for his policy through another
solicitor. I think that is about all, Mays, except that
you were ready to spring your surprise as soon as the
policies had been issued on two or three applications
now under consideration. I was in the next room to
you when you held your meeting yesterday, Mays.”
</p>
<p>
Mays had grown very white during this recital, but
he still kept his nerve, although he now showed it in
a different way.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he said, “that is about all. There are some
details lacking, but the story is practically correct.
What do you intend to do with me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
</p>
<p>
Then Mays was suddenly conscious of the fact that
a man, a stranger, was standing beside him. The
man had emerged quietly from the room in which he
had been concealed.
</p>
<p>
“There are the warrants for the whole crowd, including
this man,” said Murray, handing the stranger
a number of documents. “The charge is conspiracy,
and, if they could have secured half the fine in each
of the cases they prepared so carefully, they would
have made a pretty good thing. Now, I’ve got the
job of straightening this matter out so that both the
policies and the company will be unassailable under
the rebate law. But, at any rate, Schlimmer has got
his second lesson, and it’s a good one. Look out for
him especially, officer. If you keep this man away
from the telephone, you’ll have no difficulty in getting
Schlimmer and all the others.”

<p>
Harry Renway was the kind of man that people
refer to as “a simple soul.” He might feel deeply,
but he did not think that way. As a matter of fact,
it was stretching things a little to call him a man,
for he was hardly more than a boy—a youth in years,
but a boy in everything else. Nevertheless, it is worth
recording that he was a reasonably thrifty boy,
although his earning capacity had not permitted him
to put aside anything resembling a fortune.

Love, however, visits the poor as well as the wealthy,
the simple as well as the wise. Indeed, sometimes it
seems as if Love rather avoids the wealthy and wise and
chooses the companionship of less-favored mortals.
So, perhaps, it is not at all extraordinary that Harry
Renway was in love, and the object of his affections
was one of the most tantalizing specimens of femininity
that ever annoyed and delighted man.
</p>
<p>
She said frankly that she was mercenary, but it is
probable she exaggerated. She had been poor all her
life, but she had no dreams of great wealth and no
ambition for it: she merely wanted to be assured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
reasonable comfort—that is, what seemed to her
reasonable comfort. A really mercenary girl would
have deemed it poverty and hardship. Somehow,
when one has been poor and has suffered some privations,
one learns to give some thought to worldly
affairs, and it is to the credit of Alice Jennings that
she did not grade men more exactly by the money
standard. Harry’s modest salary would be sufficient
to meet her requirements, but Harry had nothing but
his salary. A larger salary might give something
of luxury, in addition to comfort, but, assured the
comfort and freedom from privation, she would be
guided by the inclinations of her heart. So, perhaps,
she was wise rather than mercenary. Love needs a
little of the fostering care of money, although too
much of this tends to idleness and scandal.
</p>
<p>
“But if anything should happen to you,” argued
Alice, when Harry tried to tell her how hard he would
work for her.
</p>
<p>
“What’s going to happen to me?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” she answered lightly. “You’re a
dear, good boy, Harry, and I like you, but I’ve had
all the poverty I want.”
</p>
<p>
“Who’s talking about poverty?” persisted Harry
stoutly. “I’ve got more than two hundred dollars
saved up, and I’ll have a bigger salary pretty soon.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s two hundred dollars!” she returned.
“We’d use that to begin housekeeping. Then, if anything
should happen to you—Why, Harry, I’d be
worse off than I am now. I don’t want much, but
I’ve learned to look ahead—a little. I’ve neither the
disposition nor the training to be a wage-earner, and
I’ll never go back home after I marry. Dad has a
hard enough time of it, anyhow.” There was raillery
in her tone, but there was also something of earnestness
in it. “Now, Tom Nelson has over two thousand
dollars,” she added.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you’re going to sell yourself!” exclaimed
Harry bitterly.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t say I’d marry him,” she retorted teasingly,
“but, if I did and anything happened to him—”
</p>
<p>
“You’d probably find he’d lost it in some scheme,”
put in Harry.
</p>
<p>
“He might,” admitted Alice thoughtfully, “but he’s
pretty careful.”
</p>
<p>
“And too old for you,” added Harry angrily. “Still,
if it’s only money—”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t,” she interrupted more seriously; “it’s caution.
I’ve had enough to make me just a little cautious.
You don’t know how hard it has been, Harry,
or you’d understand. If you knew more of the disappointments
and heartaches of some of the girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
who are deemed mercenary, you wouldn’t blame them
for sacrificing sentiment to a certain degree of worldliness.
’I just want to be sure I’ll never have to go
through this again,’ says the girl, and she tries to
make sure. It isn’t a question of the amount of
money she can get by marriage, nor of silks or satins,
but rather of peace and security after some years of
privation and anxiety. She learns to think of the
future, if only in a modest way—that is, some girls do.
I’m one of them. What could I do—alone?”
</p>
<p>
“Then you won’t marry me?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t say that.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you will marry me?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t say that, either. There’s no hurry.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she tantalized him always. It was unfair, of
course—unless she intended to accept him eventually.
In that case, it was merely unwise. It is accepted as
a girl’s privilege to be thus perverse and inconsistent
in her treatment of the man she intends to marry,
but sometimes she goes too far and loses him. However,
Alice Jennings was herself uncertain. She had
known Harry a long time, and she liked him. She
had known Tom Nelson a shorter time, and she liked
him also. It may be said, however, that she did not
love either of them. Love is self-sacrificing and gives
no thought to worldly affairs. Alice Jennings might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
have been capable of love, if she could have afforded
the luxury, but circumstances had convinced her that
she could not afford it, so she did not try. She would
not sell herself solely for money, and her standard of
comfort was not high, but she was trying hard to
“like” the most promising man well enough to marry
him. As far as possible, she was disposed to follow the
advice of the man who said, “Marry for love, my son,
marry for love and not for money, but, if you can love
a girl with money, for heaven’s sake do so.”
</p>
<p>
As a natural result of her desire to make sure of
escaping for all time the thraldom of poverty that was
so galling to her, she was irresolute and capricious.
She dressed unusually well for a girl in her position,
but this was because she had taste and had learned to
make her own clothes, so the money available for her
gowns could be put almost entirely into the material
alone. She was a capable housekeeper, because necessity
had compelled her to give a good deal of time
to housework in her own home. She had no thought
of escaping all these duties, irksome as they were, but
she did not wish to be bound down to them. A comfortable
flat, with a maid-of-all-work to do the cooking
and cleaning, and a sewing girl for a week once or
twice a year, was her idea of luxury. This, even
though there was still much for her to do, would give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
her freedom, and this, with reasonably careful management,
either of the men could give her. But she
looked beyond, and hesitated; she had schooled herself
to go rather deeply into the future.
</p>
<p>
Tom Nelson found her quite as unreasonable and
bewildering as did Harry. Tom was older and more
resourceful than Harry, but he was not so steady and
persistent. Harry was content to let his money accumulate
in a savings’ bank, but Tom deemed this too
slow and was willing to take risks in the hope of
larger profits. He made more, but he also spent
more, and, all else aside, it was a question as to whether
Harry would not be able to provide the better home.
Then, too, Tom occasionally lost money, while nothing
but a bank failure could endanger Harry’s modest
capital. So Tom had his own troubles with the girl.
He knew her dread of poverty—amounting almost to
a mania—and he made frequent incidental reference
to his capital.
</p>
<p>
“But that isn’t much,” she said lightly. Her self-confessed
mercenariness was always brought out in a
whimsical, half-jocular way that seemed to have nothing
of worldly hardness in it. “And there’s no telling
whether you’ll have it six months from now,” she
added. “As long as I had you to take care of me,
it would be all right, but—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
She always came back to the same point. Yet one
of these two she intended to marry, her personal
preference being for Harry, and her judgment commending
Tom. The former would plod; the latter
might be worth twenty thousand in a few years, or
he might be in debt. Harry never would have much;
Tom might have a great deal—enough to make the
future secure, no matter what happened.
</p>
<p>
“Will you invest the money for me?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Why, no,—I must use it to make more.”
</p>
<p>
Thus she flirtatiously, laughingly, but with an undertone
of seriousness, kept them both uncertain, while
she impressed upon them her one great fear of being
left helpless. Yet even in this her ambition was
modest: no income for life, but only something for
her temporary needs until she could adjust herself to
new conditions, if that became necessary. Anything
more than that was too remote for serious thought.
</p>
<p>
Harry finally told his troubles to a friend, when
these exasperating conditions had continued for some
time. He wanted consolation; he got advice.
</p>
<p>
“A little too worldly to suit me,” commented the
friend. “Still, it might be better if some of the girls
who marry hastily had just a little of such worldliness.
There would be fewer helpless and wretched
women and children.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s just it,” returned Harry. “She knows
what it means, and that two thousand of Tom Nelson’s
looks awful big to her. If I had as much I’d
invest it for her outright, and that would settle it.”
</p>
<p>
“Doesn’t want it to spend, as I understand it?”
queried the friend.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no—just to know that she has something in
case anything happens.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you try life insurance?” asked the
friend.
</p>
<p>
It took Harry a moment or two to grasp this.
Then his face lighted up.
</p>
<p>
“By thunder! I never thought of that!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the trouble with lots of men,” remarked
the friend dryly. “Marriage is considered a dual
arrangement when it should be a triple—man, woman
and life insurance. That’s the only really safe combination.
The thoughtful lover will see that the life
insurance agent and the minister are interviewed about
the same time.”
</p>
<p>
“Where did you learn all that?” asked the astonished
Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s not original with me,” was the reply. “I
heard Dave Murray talk about insurance once. He’s
an enthusiast. He claims that the best possible wedding
gift is a paid-up life insurance policy, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
guess he’s right. It would be a mighty appropriate
gift from the groom’s father to the bride—a blame
sight better than a check or a diamond necklace. A
paid-up policy for five thousand would look just as
big as a five-thousand-dollar check, and it wouldn’t
cost nearly as much—unless the old man plans to
sneak back the check before it can be cashed. And
what a lot of good it might do at a time when the
need may be the greatest! If the bride is the one
to be considered in selecting a wedding gift, as I
understand to be the case, what better than this?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess Dave Murray is the man for me,” said
Harry in admiration of the originality of this idea.
</p>
<p>
“Of course he is,” asserted the friend. “And if
you want to make the argument stronger for your
wavering girl, get an accident insurance policy, with
a sick benefit clause, also, and then take out a little
old age insurance. There ought to be no trouble about
giving her all the assurance necessary to allay her
fears.”
</p>
<p>
Harry was a good risk, and he had no difficulty in
getting a policy. He saw Murray personally, but, as
he did not explain his purpose or situation, their conference
was brief: Murray merely asked if he thought
a thousand-dollar policy was all he could afford.
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said Murray, “when you go after a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
good thing it’s wise to take all you can of it. There
ought to be enough so that something can be found
after your estate is settled.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d make it five hundred if I could,” said Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Most of the good companies,” said Murray,
“wisely protect a man from his own economical folly
by refusing to issue a policy for less than a thousand.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s an experiment. A fellow doesn’t want to put
too much money into an experiment.”
</p>
<p>
Murray, the resourceful Murray, was bewildered.
Life insurance an experiment! Surely he could not
mean that.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he said, “your widow will be pretty sure
to think the experiment a success.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t got a widow,” asserted Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not; but you may have.”
</p>
<p>
“How can I have a widow when I am dead?” asked
Harry. “How can I have anything when I am dead?”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t tell by the looks of an electric wire how
highly it is charged,” mused Murray. “I guess I
touched this one too recklessly.” Then to Harry:
“But there may be <em>a</em> widow.”
</p>
<p>
“There may,” returned Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Well, she’ll be sorry you didn’t experiment on a
larger scale, because it really isn’t an experiment at
all. There’s only one thing surer than insurance.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Harry with interest.
</p>
<p>
“Death; and, with the popular gold bonds or any
limited payment policy, you have a chance to beat
death by some years. But suit yourself.”
</p>
<p>
So Harry took the physical examination and got
the policy, payable to his estate. Then he promptly
assigned it to Alice.
</p>
<p>
“There’s one thousand dollars sure, if anything
should happen to me,” he said. “That beats any old
elusive two thousand that Tom Nelson may have.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a dear, good, faithful boy, Harry,” she
said impulsively, and she gave him a kiss.
</p>
<p>
That was happiness enough for that day and the
next, but on the third he began to get down to earth
again and deemed the time propitious.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll marry me?” he suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” was her reply.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps!” he cried. “It’s always perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it won’t be always perhaps,” she returned.
</p>
<p>
In truth, she had wavered so long that she found
it difficult to make up her mind. Besides, Tom was
prospering, Tom was devoted, and Tom was a nice
fellow. True, he was twenty-six while she was only
eighteen, and Harry, at twenty, was nearer her own
age, but—well, aside from any question of the future,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
it was rather nice to have two men so devotedly attentive.
Then, too, Tom spent his money more freely,
and she derived the benefit in present pleasures. There
was no hurry; the future was now brighter, whichever
she chose, and, things being so nearly equal,
there was even less reason for haste. Alice, in addition
to her dread of poverty, was a natural flirt:
she enjoyed the power she exerted over these two
men. But she said nothing to Tom of Harry’s latest
move; perhaps she thought it would be unfair, or
perhaps she was a trifle truer to Harry than to Tom.
</p>
<p>
Harry, in his “simple” way, misinterpreted this
irresolution. He was too devoted to criticize; he had
begun to understand her dread and to think that she
was quite right in taking such a very worldly view
of the situation. Why should she not, so far as possible,
endeavor to make her future secure? It was
for him to convince her of his thoughtfulness and his
ability to provide for her. Thereupon he got an accident
insurance policy.
</p>
<p>
“You’re awfully thoughtful, Harry,” she said. “I
like you.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want you to worry,” said Harry, flattered
and pleased.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not worrying,” she told him.
</p>
<p>
“But I am,” he retorted ruefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
“Men,” she asserted, “are <em>so</em> impatient.”
</p>
<p>
Harry could not quite agree to this—he thought
he had been wonderfully patient. In his straightforward
way he began to ponder the matter deeply. It
had seemed to him he was doing a wonderfully clever
thing that ought to settle the matter definitely. Had
he made a mistake? If so, what was necessary to
rectify it? Incidentally, he heard that some of Tom
Nelson’s little speculations had turned out favorably,
and Tom was still quite as devoted as ever and seemed
to be received with as much favor. Then to Harry
came an idea—a really brilliant idea, he thought.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” he told himself, “I ought not to have
assigned that policy to her; perhaps I ought to have
kept it in my control so that a wedding would be
necessary to give her the benefit of it. As it is now,
she has the policy, no matter whom she marries. I
don’t think she would—”
</p>
<p>
Without finishing the sentence, Harry knitted his
brow and shook his head. It was not a pleasant
thought—he told himself it was an unjust thought—but,
as he had gone in to win, he might as well take
every precaution. If the conditions were a little different,
it might put an end to her flirtatious mood
and compel a more serious consideration of his suit;
it might have a tendency to emphasize his point and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
“wake her up,” as he expressed it. Possibly, it was
just the argument needed.
</p>
<p>
With this in mind, he again called upon Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I’m in a little trouble,” he explained. “I ought
to have had that policy made out to my wife.”
</p>
<p>
“It makes no difference, unless the estate is involved
in some way,” explained Murray. “She’ll get
it through—”
</p>
<p>
“It makes a big difference,” interrupted Harry.
“You see, I’ve got to get the wife.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” ejaculated Murray. “Say that again,
please.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, if I had an insurance policy in favor of my
wife, it would make it easier to get the wife, wouldn’t
it?”
</p>
<p>
“Thunder!” exclaimed Murray. “I thought I was
pretty well up on insurance financiering, but this
beats me. Are you hanging an insurance policy up
as a sort of prize package?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it, that’s it!” cried Harry, pleased to find
the situation so quickly comprehended. “The other
fellow is worth more, but insurance looks bigger than
anything else I can buy for the money, and I want
to show her how much safer she will be with me than
with him.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re all right,” laughed Murray, “but I’m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
afraid you’ll have to marry first. We can’t very well
make a policy payable to a person who doesn’t exist,
and you have no wife now. When you have one, bring
the policy back if you’re not satisfied to have it payable
to the estate, and—”
</p>
<p>
“But she’s got it.”
</p>
<p>
“Who?”
</p>
<p>
“The girl. I assigned it to her, so she doesn’t
have to marry me to get the benefit. That wasn’t
good business.”
</p>
<p>
Murray leaned back in his chair and looked at the
youth with amusement and curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“No,” he said at last, “that may have been good
sentiment, but it wasn’t good business. And,” he
added jokingly, “I don’t know that this transaction
is quite legal.”
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” asked Harry anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’re not allowed to give prizes, and, if a
girl goes with the policy, it looks a good deal like a
prize-package affair. I’m not sure that that wouldn’t
be considered worse than giving rebates on premiums.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got the wrong idea,” argued Harry with
solemn earnestness. “The girl doesn’t go with the
policy, but the policy goes with me. At least, that’s
what I intended.”
</p>
<p>
“Better try it again with another policy,” suggested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
Murray. “Make it payable to your estate,
and then hang on to it until you get the girl. Let
me give you a word of advice, too, although it’s not
exactly to my interest.”
</p>
<p>
“Well?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, the policy that you gave to her doesn’t
amount to much if you stop paying premiums on it.
You might suggest that to her.”
</p>
<p>
“By George! I never thought of that!” exclaimed
the youth. “I guess I haven’t much of a financial
head.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you’re all right,” returned Murray. “You’re
the first fellow I ever knew who made a matrimonial
bureau of an insurance office. I’ve got something to
learn about this business yet.”
</p>
<p>
With his second policy in his pocket, Harry reverted
quite casually to the subject of insurance, although
he had first taken the precaution to have a lot of insurance
literature sent to Alice. From this she
learned that nothing could quite equal it in making
the future secure.
</p>
<p>
“I have decided,” said Harry in an offhand way,
“that the best investment for a young man who has
any one dependent upon him is life insurance. I have
just taken out another policy for a thousand dollars.”
</p>
<p>
“How thoughtful of you!” exclaimed Alice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s on the twenty-year endowment plan,” explained
Harry. “At the end of twenty years the
whole sum may be drawn down or it may be left to
accumulate. As provision for the future, I guess
that makes any two or three thousand in the bank look
like thirty cents.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re awfully good to me,” said Alice, for this
apparent evidence of unselfish devotion, in addition to
what had preceded it, really made her reproach herself
for her capriciousness. But it was such jolly fun
to keep two men anxious!
</p>
<p>
“The insurance,” Harry went on, “is payable to
my estate.”
</p>
<p>
“What does that mean, Harry?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“It means,” replied Harry, “that a girl has got
to marry me to get a chance at it.”
</p>
<p>
“I always did like you, Harry.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“But you’re so impatient.”
</p>
<p>
Harry was beginning to develop a little strategical
ingenuity.
</p>
<p>
“There is no need,” he said, “to make a secret of
this. I’m not ashamed to have all the girls know that
I am making proper provision for the one who becomes
my wife.”
</p>
<p>
“Harry Renway,” exclaimed Alice, “if you make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
our private affairs a subject of public gossip I’ll
never speak to you again as long as I live.”
</p>
<p>
Thereupon Harry demonstrated that he was not
as “simple” as he was supposed to be, for he promptly
returned the kiss that she had given him on a previous
occasion. There could be no misinterpreting “our”
private affairs.
</p>
<p>
“When?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, pretty soon,” she replied, for the flirtatious
instinct was still in evidence. Besides, under the circumstances,
too much haste might be in poor taste.
However, their friends were told of the engagement,
and that was something. Tom Nelson was angry and
disgusted.
</p>
<p>
“The fool!” he exclaimed. “A live man wants to
have the use of his money, and he has tied himself
up with insurance. That isn’t my way.”
</p>
<p>
“But he got the girl,” some one suggested.
</p>
<p>
“Not yet,” retorted Tom, “and you never can
tell.”
</p>
<p>
In truth, it seemed as if Tom’s insinuation was
almost prophetic, for Alice procrastinated and postponed
in a most tormenting way, and Harry took
it all in good part for two or three months. There
was no particular reason for this delay, as the preliminaries
of such a wedding as they would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
could be arranged very quickly, and in time it tried
the patience even of Harry.
</p>
<p>
“The semi-annual premium on that first policy is
due the day after to-morrow,” he remarked one evening.
</p>
<p>
“Well?” she returned inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
“If the premium isn’t paid the policy lapses,” he
went on.
</p>
<p>
“But you’ll pay it?”
</p>
<p>
“For my wife I will.”
</p>
<p>
She gave him a quick look and knew that he was
not going to be swayed this time by her little cajoleries.
</p>
<p>
“But, Harry,” she protested, “that’s so—so soon.”
</p>
<p>
“I have the license in my pocket,” he said; “there’s
a church within two blocks, and I saw a light in the
pastor’s study as I came by. I guess we’ve waited
long enough. Let’s go out for a little stroll.”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
It was six months later that Harry again met Dave
Murray, but Murray remembered him.
</p>
<p>
“Did you get the prize with your policy?” asked
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” replied Harry.
</p>
<p>
“Was it a good prize?”
</p>
<p>
“Bully!” said Harry. “A little hard to handle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
just at first, but you can do almost anything with insurance.”
</p>
<p>
“You certainly have made good use of it,” laughed
Murray.
</p>
<p>
“You bet I have,” answered Harry with some pride.
“Why, say! an insurance policy is the greatest thing
in the world for family discipline.”
</p>
<p>
“For what!” exclaimed Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Family discipline. The first time we had a little
rumpus she had me going seven ways for Sunday
until I thought of the insurance policies. ‘Well,’
said I, ‘if I’m not the head of the house there’s no
reason why I should be paying insurance premiums,
and I’ll default on the next one. The head of the
house looks after things of that sort,’ I told her, and
that settled it. I’m the head of the house, and, if I
don’t play it too strong, I’ve got the thing to maintain
discipline.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want another policy?” laughed Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” returned Harry thoughtfully, “if I could
get the same kind of prize with another, and if it
wasn’t against the law, I rather think I might be
tempted to do it. Anyhow, there can’t anybody tell me
there’s nothing in insurance, for I know better.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span><a name='c10' id='c10'></a>AN INCIDENTAL SACRIFICE</h2>
<p>
“I guess it’s all up with us,” said Sidney Kalin
despairingly.
</p>
<p>
“It looks that way,” admitted his brother, Albert
Kalin.
</p>
<p>
The father, Jonas Kalin, sat at his desk with his
head half-buried in his hands.
</p>
<p>
“There is no chance for an extension, of course,”
he said wearily.
</p>
<p>
“I should say not,” returned Sidney. “Telmer
bought up the mortgage for just one purpose, and
his only hope of success lies in foreclosing. He wants
to get his hands on the invention.”
</p>
<p>
“Will he take an interest in the business?” asked
Jonas.
</p>
<p>
“Why should he, when he can get the only thing
he wants without?” returned Sidney.
</p>
<p>
“What does Dempsey say?” persisted the senior
Kalin.
</p>
<p>
“It’s out of his line,” answered Albert, to whom
the question was addressed. “If five thousand would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
straighten the thing out, he might risk it, but he
wouldn’t put up a cent more than that, and he’d want
a twenty-five per cent. interest in the business for that
sum.”
</p>
<p>
“And, if we can save it, the thing is worth a fortune,”
groaned Jonas. “We’ve got a start already,
and there’s almost no limit to the possibilities. It
ought to be worth fifty thousand a year inside of three
years. He doesn’t want much.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he’s out of the question, anyway,” said
Sidney. “We’ve got to have twenty-five thousand,
and we’ve got to have it mighty soon.”
</p>
<p>
“My life insurance is more than that,” mused Jonas.
</p>
<p>
“What good does that do?” retorted Sidney rather
sharply. “Even if you wanted to surrender it, the
cash surrender value is less than ten thousand at the
present time.”
</p>
<p>
“That would help,” argued Jonas.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing will help that doesn’t put the full sum
needed within our reach,” asserted Albert. “We’re
about due to begin life over again with a little less
than nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll think it over,” said Jonas, rising and wearily
reaching for his hat. “I’ve always weathered the
storms before. Perhaps I’ll find a way to weather this
one.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
Jonas Kalin once had been accounted a successful
real estate man, but he had lost a good deal of money
in speculation, and the time and thought he gave to
speculation had had an injurious effect upon his business.
One of the sons had been for a time in the employ
of a manufacturer of fountain pens. Later the
elder Kalin had started both boys, as an independent
firm, in that line of business, their pen differing sufficiently
from others to avoid any infringement of
patents on patented features. They had made no
great amount of money, indeed barely a living income,
but they had kept out of debt until Sidney invented
a machine for finishing the shell or case of the pen.
</p>
<p>
His experiments had been rather costly, and the
machine had been costly to construct, but he had
convinced his father that it was a good thing, and
Jonas had given up his dwindling real estate business
and put what money he had left into his sons’ firm,
becoming a partner in the enterprise. Even then it
had been found necessary to borrow twenty-five thousand
dollars in order to establish the business on the
new and larger basis, giving a mortgage on the entire
plant, which included the new machine, and this
mortgage had passed into the hands of a more prosperous
business rival at a time when the value of the
invention was just becoming apparent. This invention
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
largely reduced the cost of production, but the
exploiting so far done, although expensive and reasonably
successful, had not enabled the Kalins to accumulate
anything to meet their obligation. Indeed, believing
they would have no difficulty in securing an
extension, they had not worried about this until they
found themselves in the power of a rival.
</p>
<p>
The machine had not been patented, for reasons
that most successful inventors will readily understand.
While a patent is supposed to protect the
inventor, it does not do so in many instances; on the
contrary, it frequently gives a rival just the information
he needs to duplicate the device with technical
variations that will at least make the question of
infringement a difficult one to decide. The inventor
of limited means, opposed by a company with almost
unlimited capital, is at a serious disadvantage when
he gets into the courts, and there are cases where the
value of an invention has been largely destroyed by
having the market flooded with the article before the
legal rights can be definitely determined. There is
hardly a single patented device of great value that
has not been the basis of long and costly litigation,
involving either the unauthorized use or manufacture
of the device as it is or the use or manufacture of a
device suggested by the original and differing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
it only enough to give technical plausibility to the
plea that it is not an infringement. Even the great
Edison is reported to have said that he has made
practically no money on his patents, but has had to
enter the manufacturing business to get any material
benefit from his inventions.
</p>
<p>
“When you patent an invention,” the Kalins had
been informed by a man of experience in such matters,
“you are furnishing ammunition to the enemy.
You are giving him your secret, and he will put some
smart men at work to discover some method of using
it himself. Edison is still busy with inventions, but
you don’t see his name in the patent reports any
more. He has become too wise for that. Secrecy is
the best protection, provided you have something that
can be kept secret.”
</p>
<p>
All this Jonas Kalin reviewed as he walked slowly
and with bowed head toward his club. They had
kept their invention secret, they had advertised extensively,
and now, just as they were beginning to
get returns on their investment, the dream was shattered.
They had tried to interest various capitalists,
but capitalists could not see the future as they saw it.
Capital is exceptionally conservative when there is
a question of investing in inventions that it does not
understand, for inventors are proverbially optimistic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
and not infrequently cost capital a good deal of
money.
</p>
<p>
“Thirty thousand dollars of life insurance!” muttered
Jonas, as he settled himself in a corner of the
reading-room. “If we could have the use of that
money for a year we would be all right.”
</p>
<p>
Jonas was a widower, but his wife had been living
when he had taken out this insurance. Now it would
go to the sons eventually, if they survived him, but,
meanwhile, they would lose a fortune. Since the death
of his wife, Jonas had given his every thought to the
boys and their future. He reproached himself for
the speculations that had deprived him of the power
of helping them as he had planned in earlier days; he
felt that somehow he had defrauded them. So deeply
did he feel this that from the day he gave up his real
estate business he never had put one dollar into a
speculation of any kind, except so far as his investment
in their business was a speculation.
</p>
<p>
“If we could make that go,” he mused, as he
crouched miserably in the big chair, “I should be content.
I owe it to the boys to see them fairly started.
I was in a position to do it once and I lost the money
foolishly—their money, by rights, for I had put it
aside for them. And here am I, almost useless—a
business wreck—too old to begin again as an employee
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
and lacking the capital to be an employer or to do
business of any sort for myself. Instead of helping
my boys, I am to be a burden to them—until I die.
I am of value only in the grave.” He shuddered and
seemed to sink still lower in the chair. “It is my duty
to do what I can for them,” he added. “I am useless,
but life is before them—a continuation of my life.
I must be a success through my sons.”
</p>
<p>
Benson, a friend, stopped near him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Kalin?” asked Benson. “You
look blue.”
</p>
<p>
Kalin looked up at Benson in a dazed way, and for
a moment seemed to be unable to grasp the fact that
he had been addressed.
</p>
<p>
“Benson,” he said at last, his eyes wandering
dreamily about the room, “is a man ever justified in
committing suicide?”
</p>
<p>
Benson was startled, but he replied promptly and
emphatically, “Never.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose,” Kalin went on, “that your life intervened
between those you love and happiness; suppose
that your life meant misery and failure for them,
while your death meant success and—and comfort.”
</p>
<p>
Benson drew up a chair and placed his hand on
Kalin’s arm as if to emphasize his words.
</p>
<p>
“<em>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away</em>,” he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
quoted earnestly. “Life is God’s gift and should be
treasured as such. You may not return it until He
calls, unless you would doubt His wisdom.”
</p>
<p>
Kalin nodded his head thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Men have gone to certain death for those they
love and been glorified for so doing,” he argued.
</p>
<p>
“A man may <em>give</em> his own life to save the life of
another and be a hero,” returned Benson, “but he
may not <em>take</em> his own life for any cause and be aught
but a coward.”
</p>
<p>
“What matters it whether he takes it or gives it,
so long as the purpose is the same?” asked Kalin.
</p>
<p>
Benson gripped the arm on which his hand lay and
shook Kalin.
</p>
<p>
“Wake up!” he commanded sharply. “What’s the
matter with you to-day?”
</p>
<p>
Kalin roused himself, as if from a dream, and
laughed in a forced, dreary way.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing is the matter with me,” he replied. “I
must have been reading something that gave my
thoughts a morbid turn. Still, your reasoning seems
to be that of a man who never has been tested. Your
view has been my view, but I can see how a man’s
views may change when he is confronted by the actual
conditions concerning which he has previously only
theorized. I don’t think you’re right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s a disagreeable subject, even for abstract consideration,”
asserted Benson. “Let’s drop it.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Kalin. “I’m going in to lunch.”
</p>
<p>
In the dining-room he got into an obscure corner
and the waiter had to joggle his elbow to rouse him
from the reverie into which he immediately fell. Then,
after barely tasting the lunch he ordered, he went to
the office of the club and asked that all charges against
him be footed up.
</p>
<p>
“There’s nothing against me at all now?” he said
inquiringly as he paid the bill.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing at all, sir,” replied the clerk.
</p>
<p>
“I’d hate to leave any club debts,” he remarked,
as if talking aloud to himself.
</p>
<p>
At his office he found his sons still gloomily discussing
the situation.
</p>
<p>
“I think,” he said, “that I have found a way to
save the business.”
</p>
<p>
“How?” they asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“The details are not quite clear in my mind yet,”
he replied. “I would like to give them a little more
thought before explaining the matter. But, if I succeed
in pulling you through, you boys must be
mighty careful in the future. A concern doesn’t get
out of this kind of hole twice, and I’m going to turn
it all over to you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why?” asked Albert in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I ruined one business,” was the reply. “One is
enough. Be cautious. Go slow. You’ve got a good
thing—a fortune—if you handle your finances properly
and don’t try to spread out too fast.”
</p>
<p>
He shook hands with both the boys, to their great
bewilderment.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going?” asked Sidney. “One would
think you were starting on a long journey.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m taking leave of the business,” he answered,
with a laugh that had something of pathos in it. “I’m
going to shut myself up for a day or so until I get
my little scheme elaborated, and then you shall have
the benefit of it, but I am out of active business.”
</p>
<p>
Sidney and Albert were silent for some time after
he had left. Jonas Kalin always had been a rather
eccentric man, and they were accustomed to letting
his whims and peculiarities of word and action pass
without comment, but there was something in this
parting that made them feel uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like it,” remarked Sidney. “I wonder if
the worry and disappointment have been too much
for him.”
</p>
<p>
“It is a hard blow to him—not for himself, but for
us,” returned Albert. “However, we’ll see him this
evening.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Albert Kalin was the housekeeper for the three
men. Sidney, being a bachelor, had always lived with
his father, but Albert had married and moved away
from the parental roof. Then, when his mother died,
Jonas had called him back and practically turned
the house over to him and his wife, reserving only one
large room for himself. In this he had his own little
library, and to this he frequently retired for long
evenings of solitude, for, while not a recluse, he was
a man who really needed no other companionship
than his own thoughts and often seemed to avoid the
society of others.
</p>
<p>
He was not at home, however, when his sons arrived
for dinner. Mrs. Albert Kalin said he had
brought home two or three bundles early in the afternoon,
had gone directly to his room, where he remained
for about an hour, and had then appeared with a
valise.
</p>
<p>
“I never saw him look so haggard and distressed,”
she explained. “He kissed me most affectionately and
said he had some business to attend to and would
not be home to-night.”
</p>
<p>
Late that evening Sidney Kalin went to his father’s
club, where he saw Benson and learned enough to
send him to police headquarters. There was no publicity,
but a search for the missing man was begun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
at once. The circumstances were, to say the least,
disquieting.
</p>
<p>
At the moment this search was begun Jonas Kalin
was crossing Lake Michigan on one of the large steamers,
and his actions were such as to attract the attention
of some of the other passengers. It was a Friday
night boat and was crowded with excursionists bound
for a Saturday and Sunday outing in Michigan.
Jonas had a state-room, but he merely put his valise
in it, and then paced the deck, occasionally stopping
to lean over the rail and look down at the water.
Once or twice he sought a secluded corner and sat
for a time buried in thought, but he moved away the
moment others stopped near him. About eleven
o’clock, as he passed through the main cabin, he saw
a woman putting a little boy to bed on a sofa, and
he offered her his state-room.
</p>
<p>
“I’m very grateful to you, sir,” she replied, “but
we couldn’t think of taking it. You’ll need it yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall not sleep to-night,” he said. “It will be
vacant unless you take it. Shove the valise into a
corner somewhere and I’ll get it in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
He dropped the state-room key on a chair and disappeared
through a door leading to the deck before
she could make further protest, but his face haunted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
her all that night. In the morning, after some search,
she found him huddled up on a camp-stool against
the rail of the forward deck, and she thanked him
again.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t look well,” she ventured. “Can I do
anything for you?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not a question of what any one can do for
me,” he answered, “but of what I can do for others.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand you, sir,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a good thing you don’t,” he returned, and,
fearing that she had to deal with a crazy man, she
left him.
</p>
<p>
After landing, he went directly to a hotel, engaged
a room, and shut himself up in it until afternoon.
Then he went to the dock and wandered nervously
back and forth, looking out over the water and occasionally
down into it. The dock men watched him
curiously, and one of them loosened a life-preserver
that hung near, but he went back to the hotel without
giving them an opportunity to use it.
</p>
<p>
He kept close to his room at the hotel, and was so
unobtrusive that the clerks and the other guests hardly
realized he was there, and, being registered under
an assumed name, not one of them recognized him as
the Jonas Kalin who was described in the Sunday papers
as being missing. For, the secret search Friday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
night and Saturday failing to reveal any trace of him,
his sons had decided to try the effect of publicity.
</p>
<p>
It was not until he had surrendered his room Sunday
night that his identity was established. On the
table was found a letter, sealed, addressed to Sidney
Kalin.
</p>
<p>
“Kalin!” cried the clerk, when the letter was
brought to him. “Good Lord! that’s the man who
disappeared. And there’s a reward for information.
I remember, too, he had all the Sunday papers sent to
his room, and then kept out of the way until the
moment he left.”
</p>
<p>
The clerk looked at the letter, uncertain as to what
he ought to do. Finally, he decided to get the Chicago
police department on the long-distance telephone.
</p>
<p>
“Jonas Kalin has been here for two days under an
assumed name,” he reported, “but his identity was
discovered only after he had taken the night boat
back to Chicago. He left a letter. It is sealed and
addressed to Sidney Kalin.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll notify Kalin and meet the boat,” was the
prompt reply. “Hold the letter until you hear from
Kalin.”
</p>
<p>
A little later Kalin called up the hotel and instructed
that the letter be mailed to him at once. As
Jonas was already on his way back, nothing would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
gained by having its contents transmitted by telephone.
He was beyond reach until the boat arrived.
</p>
<p>
It was an anxious little crowd that waited at the
wharf for the arrival of the boat. There were Albert
and Sidney Kalin, two detectives and some newspaper
men. The news of Jonas Kalin’s sojourn across the
lake was already in the morning papers, having come
by telegraph, and there was natural curiosity to learn
the reason for this strange procedure. In addition,
there was an undefined and unexpressed feeling that
there might be a tragedy back of it. In any event,
there was a mystery.
</p>
<p>
The boat reached its dock before five o’clock, but the
state-room passengers had the privilege of sleeping
until seven, so only the excursionists who had been
obliged to sit up all night left the boat at once. There
were many of these, however—a weary and disheveled
lot of individuals, groups and couples straggling
along to the dock. They were talking of something
that had happened during the night, or was supposed
to have happened. Something or some one
certainly had gone over the rail, for the splash was
distinctly heard, and an excitable passenger had
raised the cry of “Man overboard!” The boat had
been stopped, but investigation had failed to discover
an actual witness to any such accident, although two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
people were sure they had seen something in the water
just after the splash. The captain, however, insisted
that it was all the result of some nervous person’s
imagination.
</p>
<p>
To Albert and Sidney Kalin these rumors brought
sinking hearts and a great dread. It took them a
little time to locate the state-room that had been occupied
by their father, but a description of him, coupled
with the name he had used at the hotel, enabled them
to do it.
</p>
<p>
His valise alone was found.
</p>
<p>
Several people remembered the haggard man who
had tramped the deck so restlessly. He seemed to be
in great mental distress, anxious only to keep away
from all companionship, and no one could recall having
seen him after the cry of “Man overboard!” Even
the captain had finally to admit that it was probable
he had lost a passenger, although, of course, no blame
whatever attached to him or to any of the boat’s
crew.
</p>
<p>
Then came the letter that had been forwarded from
the hotel. It was pathetically brief and to the point,
as follows:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“My Dear Sons: The insurance money will pull
you through. It is all that I can give you. Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
success is dearer to me than anything else in the world.
Your affectionate father,
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'><span class='sc'>Jonas Kalin</span>.</p>
<p>
Of course, Dave Murray read the story in the
papers—all but the letter. That was brought to him
later by Albert Kalin.
</p>
<p>
“We wish to give you all the facts, without reservation,”
Albert explained. “Father did this for us
to save the firm, to save an almost priceless invention.”
The young man choked a little. “We have
hoped against hope that his letter might prove to be
capable of some other interpretation, or that he may
have changed his mind after writing it, and we have
left no stone unturned—”
</p>
<p>
“Neither have we,” said Murray quietly. “Perhaps
we know more than you.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you got trace of him?” asked Albert quickly,
and his face showed a dawn of hope that could not be
misunderstood: he actually believed his father dead
and would welcome any evidence to the contrary. It
was not the expression of a man who was principally
interested in the payment of the insurance money,
although he was naturally presenting his and his
brother’s claim.
</p>
<p>
“I am sorry to say we have not,” replied Murray,
“but neither have we any proof of death.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
Albert plainly showed his disappointment at Murray’s
first statement, and it was a moment or two before
he replied to the second.
</p>
<p>
“I do not know your rules or aims,” he said, “but
it is possible—indeed almost probable, under the circumstances—that
there never will be any absolute
proof of death. It—it happened in mid-lake, you
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Our aim,” returned Murray, “is to pay every
claim that we are convinced is just, without resorting
to any quibbling or technical evasions, but we have
to be careful. In saying this, I am merely stating a
general proposition, without particular reference to
this affair. Indeed, I concede that the presumption
of death is unusually strong in this case. I shall be
glad to have any facts bearing on it that you can give
me.”
</p>
<p>
Albert fully reviewed the circumstances as he knew
them, to all of which Murray listened attentively.
</p>
<p>
“I shall make a complete report to the home office,”
said Murray at the conclusion of the recital. “Of
course, after the lapse of a certain period there is a
legal presumption of death, anyhow, but it is possible
that the circumstantial evidence may be deemed strong
enough to warrant an earlier settlement. Knowing
the ostensible motive, I appreciate the value of time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
to you, and I assure you the company has no desire
to delay matters longer than is necessary to assure
itself of the justice of the claim.”
</p>
<p>
After Albert had departed, Murray went over the
case carefully, and the evidence seemed quite convincing.
In the first place, there could be no question as
to a very strong motive. There was the certainty of
ruin, which the death of Jonas alone could avert, and,
after a lapse of two years from the date of the policy,
suicide did not invalidate it. Therefore, by his own
sacrifice, he could purchase a bright future for his
sons. Then there could be no doubt that he had been
depressed and worried for some time, and latterly unquestionably
had brooded on the subject of self-destruction.
In a talk with one man he had spoken of
it as “self-elimination,” but he had spoken more
bluntly to Benson at the club. There could be no
doubt now that he contemplated such action at that
time, and that he had reference to it when he told
his sons he had discovered a way to raise the necessary
money. Everything indicated that his troubles had
made him temporarily insane.
</p>
<p>
Then there was the evidence of the woman to whom
he had resigned his state-room on the boat, and of
various other passengers who had noted his restlessness
and his misery. One woman even asserted that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
she had said to a companion at the time that there
was a man who contemplated some desperate act. It
seemed probable that he had planned to jump overboard
that first night, but had been deterred, either
by lack of a favorable opportunity or because his
courage failed him. His actions at the hotel, and
especially at the dock, were wholly consistent with
this theory, and the blunt note he left was further
evidence of mental derangement. Although his purpose
in no way affected his policy, a man in his right
mind would hardly have stated it so frankly; indeed,
a sane man probably would have tried to give the appearance
of accident to his death. Finally, he had
boarded the return boat and was missing when the
boat reached Chicago, although his strange actions
had directed particular attention to him during the
early part of the trip.
</p>
<p>
After a brief delay the company paid the policy.
The circumstantial evidence could hardly be more
convincing, and the body of a man who drowned himself
in mid-lake might never be recovered.

<p>
It was several years later that Albert Kalin called
upon Murray and introduced himself a second time.
</p>
<p>
“We have just heard from father,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Murray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
</p>
<p>
“He died in South America,” explained Albert;
“died there miserably—not because of any poverty,
but because he was an exile and felt that he was a
swindler. He left a letter which was forwarded to us.
His life, he said, had been one long torture since that
night on the boat, and he had a thousand times regretted
that he did not actually throw himself into
the lake. I fear,” added Albert sadly, “that he really
did commit suicide finally. He made one dying request.
I would like to read it to you.”
</p>
<p>
Albert took a letter from his pocket and read this
paragraph:
</p>
<p>
“My life as an exiled swindler has been hell, but I
have seen the Chicago papers and I know that I saved
the firm and the invention and that you have prospered.
That has been my only consolation. It would
have been some relief if I could have communicated
with you, but I would not make you a party to my
crime. Now, at last, I ask you to do something for
the old man: Refund to the insurance company every
cent you received, less the premiums I actually paid.
Refund it all, if necessary, but make my record clear.
That was the only dishonest act of a long business
career, and God only knows how I have suffered for
it. You have prospered, you can do this, and I know
you will. It is that alone that gives me consolation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
as my period of punishment at last draws to a
close.”
</p>
<p>
“How did he do it?” asked Murray, before Albert
could speak.
</p>
<p>
“He purchased and took with him a second-hand
suit of clothes and a wig,” explained Albert. “He cut
off his whiskers and mustache, so that he appeared as
a man who had neglected to shave for a week—a
pretty good disguise in itself, for father was always
neat and clean. The clothes he had worn went overboard
with a weight attached, which accounts for the
splash, and he himself raised the cry of ‘Man overboard!’
After that he kept out of the light, and he
had little difficulty in slipping ashore while we were
hunting his state-room. His mental distress was real,
for he was leaving all he held dear and condemning
himself to exile.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” commented Murray, “I guess the circumstances
would have fooled any one, for his whole
previous life made him about the last man who would
be suspected of anything of that sort.”
</p>
<p>
“And now,” said Albert, “my brother and I are
prepared to make a cash settlement with you on any
basis that you deem satisfactory.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span><a name='c11' id='c11'></a>AN INCIDENTAL DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>
The applicant for insurance was nervous and ill
at ease, but that alone was not sufficient to make Dave
Murray suspicious. A man taking out his first policy
is very often nervous—he dreads the physical examination
in many instances. He may think he is all
right, but he fears the possibility of some serious latent
trouble. If there is anything radically and incurably
wrong with the average man, he prefers not to know
it. He may not say so, but he does. He goes before
the medical examiner with the fear that he may learn
something disagreeable.
</p>
<p>
“I’m fairly contented now,” he says to himself, if
he happens to be practical enough to put his thoughts
into words, “but life will be a haunting hell to me if I
learn that I am not a good risk. That will mean at
least the probability of an early death. It will not
change conditions, but it will seem to bring death
nearer.”
</p>
<p>
These thoughts do not come to the very young man,
but they do come to the man who has passed, or is
passing, the optimism of youth. In the words of Dave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
Murray, “One of the great annoyances of the life insurance
business is that the very young man is too well
and strong to want to be insured, and the man of
middle age is afraid of learning that he is not as well
and strong as he thinks he is. We have to fight
optimism first and cowardice later. Theoretically, the
‘risk’ ought to be caught young, but, practically, it is
easier to catch him when he has begun to appreciate
the responsibilities of life. The optimism is more difficult
to overcome than the cowardice.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the man who has neglected to take
out insurance when he could get the best rate is likely
to be nervous when he applies for it later, however
hard he may try to conceal the fact. And Elmer
Harkness was nervous. He was a year short of forty,
apparently in the best physical condition, but he was
unusually nervous. He hesitated over his answers to
the most ordinary questions, he corrected himself once
or twice, and he betrayed a strong desire to get
through with the ordeal in the quickest possible time.
When, at last, he was able to leave, the physician having
completed his examination, he gave a very audible
sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
“There’s something about this I don’t like,” commented
Murray a little later.
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked the doctor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s the trouble,” returned Murray. “I can’t
say exactly what it is, but I have a feeling that something
is wrong. We’ve had nervous men here before.
Remember the fellow who was brought up by his wife
and who would have ducked and run if he could have
got the chance? He was nervous enough, but not in
the same way. He was afraid he would find he was
going to die next week, but this fellow was shifty.
How does he stand physically, doctor?”
</p>
<p>
“Fine,” answered the doctor. “You couldn’t ask
a better risk.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he doesn’t get the policy until I’ve made a
pretty thorough investigation, in addition to the usual
investigation from headquarters,” announced Murray.
</p>
<p>
It took a good deal really to disturb Murray, but
this case disturbed him before he got through with it.
His first discovery was that Elmer Harkness had been
refused insurance by another company some years
previous. This information came from the home
office, which had secured it through the “clearing-house.”
</p>
<p>
“The risk was refused,” said the report, “on the
advice of the company’s physician.”
</p>
<p>
“Must be another Harkness,” said the doctor, when
Murray told him about it. “This man was in splendid
physical condition.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“The Elmer Harkness refused,” said Murray, consulting
the papers before him, “was born at Madison,
Indiana, January twentieth, 1866, and that is the
place and date of birth given by the man who applied
to us. You don’t suppose there were twins, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“Might look it up,” suggested the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, I’ll look it up,” returned Murray. “It’s
mighty funny that a man who was refused on physical
grounds five years ago should be a superb risk now.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s one satisfaction,” remarked the doctor.
“With the safeguards thrown around the business in
these modern days, a man can’t very well beat us.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s no game that can’t be beaten,” asserted
Murray emphatically. “There is no burglar-proof
safe. With improvements in safes there has come a
corresponding improvement in cracksmen’s methods.
No man is so much superior to all other men that he
can devise a thing so perfect that some other can not
find the flaw that makes it temporarily worthless. The
burglar-proof safes have to be watched to keep burglars
away from them. The insurance system is as good
as we now know how to make it, but it has to be
watched to keep swindlers from punching holes in it.
When we further improve the system they will further
improve their methods, and we’ll have to keep on
watching. The business concern that thinks it has an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
infallible system to protect itself from loss is then in
the greatest danger.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think this case a swindle?” asked the doctor.
</p>
<p>
“It’s better to get facts before reaching conclusions,”
replied Murray. “It may be only an extraordinary
coincidence. The man who was refused insurance
was not then living where the man who applied
to us is now living. That’s worth considering.”
</p>
<p>
But investigation only made the case the more puzzling.
From Madison, Indiana, a report was received
that Elmer Harkness was born there on the date given,
and that nothing was known of any second Elmer
Harkness. The father of the Elmer born at Madison
had been Abner Harkness, who was now dead. The
name of the father of the man who had applied to
Murray was given as Abner, and that also was the
name of the father of the man whose application had
been previously refused. Elmer, after the death of
his parents, had left Madison, and nothing had been
heard of him since, although he was supposed to be
in Chicago.
</p>
<p>
“Strange!” commented Murray. “This Madison
Harkness is our Harkness, beyond question, and he
also corresponds, except physically, to the Harkness
who was refused.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
So far as was known at Madison, Harkness was
physically sound and well. He certainly had been considered
a strong, healthy man.
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Murray, “answers the description of
the man who was here, but it really means nothing, as
far as the other refusal is concerned. Heart trouble
was the cause of that refusal, and there hardly would
have been any indication of that to the casual observer.
This Madison Harkness may well have been the man
who was refused or the man who applied to us, but he
can hardly be both—unless you have made a mistake,
Doctor.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll examine him again,” said the doctor.
</p>
<p>
So he sent for Harkness again, on the plea that he
had mislaid the record of the previous examination,
and this time he gave particular attention to the heart.
</p>
<p>
“Normal and strong,” he reported. “No trouble
there. It’s possible he had some slight temporary affection
when he was examined for the other company.
The heart is sometimes most deceptive, and there are
occasionally apparent evidences of a serious malady
where none really exists. In some cases I’ve discovered
symptoms of heart trouble at one examination
and found them absolutely lacking a little later. This
man is all right.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Murray questioned Harkness closely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure,” he asked, the question having been
previously answered when the application was made,
“that you never were refused by any other company?”
</p>
<p>
“I never applied for insurance before,” replied
Harkness, but there was the same shifty look in his
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever know another Harkness at Madison,
Indiana?”
</p>
<p>
Harkness looked frightened, but he answered
promptly in the negative.
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been since you left Madison?”
</p>
<p>
Harkness told briefly of his movements.
</p>
<p>
“Did you ever live at 1176 Wabash Avenue?”
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
The case became even more mystifying. There was
a record of only one Elmer Harkness at Madison, but
it was evident that two had applied for insurance, for
the Harkness who had been refused had given his address
as 1176 Wabash Avenue.
</p>
<p>
“I am tempted,” said Murray later, “to make a
strong adverse report. At the same time I don’t want
to do an injustice and refuse a man who is rightfully
entitled to insurance. My refusal, coupled with the
mystifying record, would make it practically impossible
to get insurance anywhere at any time, and he
may be all right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
</p>
<p>
“If there’s a fraud in it anywhere,” remarked the
doctor, “there are some clever and experienced people
behind it.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite the contrary,” returned Murray. “The experienced
people are the people we catch, because they
do things the way one naturally expects. As a general
thing, you will find that the police are fooled, not
by the professional criminal, but by the novice who
is ignorant of the ways of the crook, and the same
rule applies to insurance swindles. If there is anything
wrong here our difficulty lies in the fact that
this fellow and those behind him are not experienced
and are not going at the thing the way an experienced
swindler would.”
</p>
<p>
An attempt to identify the Harkness who had applied
for insurance as the Harkness who had lived at
1176 Wabash Avenue failed utterly, owing to the fact
that the woman who had formerly conducted a boarding-house
at that number had moved and it was impossible
to find her. It was a simple matter, however,
to verify other statements made by Harkness. He was
now living at 2313 Wesson Street, and was employed
by a large wholesale grocery firm. His employer
spoke highly of him, but knew nothing of his personal
affairs. He might or might not be married. The
employer had been under the impression that he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
a bachelor, but could not recall that Harkness ever
had said so. This confusion was partly explained at
the Wesson Street boarding-house, for Harkness had
recently told the landlady that he expected his wife
to join him soon. He explained that she had been
visiting relatives during the six months he had been
at this house, but that they were planning to take a
small flat. They had previously had a flat, the address
of which he gave, and the agent for the building
remembered that Elmer Harkness had been among his
tenants for two years. He knew very little about
them, except that Harkness had paid his rent
promptly and had been a model tenant.
</p>
<p>
“And there you are!” grumbled Murray. “He’s
all right, and I wouldn’t hesitate a minute, except for
this other Harkness who hailed from the same place,
lived in Wabash Avenue, and was refused insurance.
Who was he? How can there be two Elmers from a
town that produced only one?”
</p>
<p>
“Possibly it is the same Elmer,” suggested the doctor.
“Possibly he was refused owing to some temporary
trouble that deceived the first physician. Possibly
he did live at the Wabash Avenue place, but
thought his chance of getting insurance would be better
if he denied that he ever had been refused, and,
having once told that story, he has had to stick to it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
Of course, he had no means of knowing our facilities
for getting information.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see,” returned Murray, “that our facilities
have succeeded in doing more than confuse us in this
case. However, I’ll submit the whole matter to the
home office.”
</p>
<p>
After taking some time for consideration, the home
office decided that there was no reason for refusing the
risk.
</p>
<p>
“If you are sure this man is physically all right,”
was the reply received, “and that he is the man he
represents himself to be, there would seem to be no
reason for refusing the risk. There may have been
some attempt at fraud, with which he had nothing to
do, in the other case, and none in this. In any event,
if the man who applied to you is a good risk physically,
and a man of good reputation, as your report indicates,
we are willing to give him the policy.”
</p>
<p>
In these circumstances there was no reason for refusal.
Harkness was a man of good reputation. Because
of the other apparently mythical Harkness, he
had been investigated more thoroughly than was usually
deemed necessary, and his references had proved
to be good. The inquiries had been made cautiously
and circumspectly, to avoid giving offense, and the
replies had been generally satisfactory. Nevertheless,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
Murray had another talk with him before delivering
the policy.
</p>
<p>
Harkness told whom and when he married, and the
truthfulness of this statement was capable of easy
verification. His wife, he said, had been away for some
time, but was now returning.
</p>
<p>
“We shall take a small flat again,” he explained.
“I have already selected one in Englewood—on Sixty-fourth
Street. A fellow can get more for his money
out there than he can nearer the city.”
</p>
<p>
Then Harkness got his policy, and a little later he
notified the company that he had moved to the Sixty-fourth
Street flat. Murray puzzled his head a little
over the mysterious Harkness, and once took the
trouble to learn that the Harkness he had insured was
still employed by the wholesale grocery firm. Then
other matters claimed his attention, and the Harkness
case was forgotten. There seemed to be no doubt
that it was a good risk, even if there was a mystery
back of it somewhere.
</p>
<p>
It was six months later that he was notified of the
sudden death at the Sixty-fourth Street flat of Elmer
Harkness, who had a policy in his company. Instantly
the details of the case, and his misgivings at
the time, returned to him. Yet the proof of death,
signed by a reputable and well-known physician, was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
flawless. A latent heart trouble had developed suddenly,
and Harkness had died within forty-eight
hours after he was stricken. The physician who had
attended him never had been called for Harkness before,
but he had been at the flat a number of times to
prescribe for the trifling ailments of Mrs. Harkness,
and he had become well acquainted with the husband.
They had moved into the neighborhood about six
months before.
</p>
<p>
“It all fits in with what we know of the case,” commented
Murray, “except the heart trouble. That
sounds like the mysterious Harkness. Could you have
possibly made any mistake in your examination,
Doctor?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly I could,” admitted the company’s physician
ruefully. “None of us is infallible, but I’ll swear
there were no indications of any heart trouble when I
examined him. Still, the heart is a mighty deceptive
organ. There may be trouble without any indications
of it and there may be indications without any trouble.
I once knew of a man whose heart seemed to skip a
beat once in so often, but the best of medical talent
was unable to discover the cause of it, and the man
lived to a good old age. I don’t claim infallibility, but
I never examined a man who seemed freer from any
indications of heart trouble.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” said Murray thoughtfully, “if Harkness’
employer has heard of his death.”
</p>
<p>
An insurance company is merciless in following up
evidence of attempted fraud, but, lacking such evidence,
it is wise to conduct investigations with extreme
delicacy. A reputation for unnecessary intrusion or
harshness, for a lack of sympathy with the bereaved,
for any action that implies a suspicion of dishonesty
when the proof is lacking, may do a great deal of
harm. Every reputable company is anxious to pay
all honest claims with as little inconvenience to the
beneficiaries as is compatible with safety. Such investigation
as may be necessary in some exceptional case
is conducted as unobtrusively as possible.
</p>
<p>
In this instance, the ordinary proof of death would
have been accepted without question were it not for
the mystery of the “heart trouble” that was supposed
not to exist. This, combined with the report on the
other Harkness, was annoying, and, to satisfy himself,
Murray sent a man to the wholesale house where
Harkness had been employed. The result was reassuring,
so far as any question of fraud was concerned.
The other clerks were then taking up a subscription
to send some flowers to the funeral, and his illness and
death had been reported promptly to the head of the
department in which Harkness had worked. Furthermore,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
he was registered as living at the Sixty-fourth
Street flat, to which place he had moved from 2313
Wesson Street.
</p>
<p>
“It seems to be all right,” remarked Murray. “This
is the man we insured on the strength of your report,
Doctor, and I guess the only thing we can do is to
charge you up with an error of judgment. Fortunately,
it’s only a three-thousand-dollar policy.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t understand it,” said the doctor gloomily.
“I wish we could demand an autopsy.”
</p>
<p>
“Hardly justifiable, in view of the circumstances,”
returned Murray. “We have the affidavit of a first-class
physician, and we know that it’s the same man,
so the autopsy would be only to satisfy your curiosity.
My own curiosity deals with the Wabash Avenue man
who was refused. I wish we could locate him, although
I don’t see that it would have any bearing on this case.
He seems to have disappeared utterly. Perhaps he’s
dead.”
</p>
<p>
Before dismissing the matter from his mind, Murray
reviewed the facts carefully. There had been an
application to another company from a man living
at 1176 Wabash Avenue, which had been refused because
of heart trouble, but the city directory for that
year gave no Harkness at that address. It did give
an Elmer Harkness at another address, however, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
coincided with the story told by the Harkness he had
insured.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody,” mused Murray, “must have been trying
to beat the other company. That’s the best I can
make out of it, although I can’t see why he should
have assumed this Elmer’s name and antecedents. It’s
a most extraordinary case.”
</p>
<p>
The latest city directory gave Elmer Harkness as
living at 2313 Wesson Street, which certainly was his
address at the time the directory was issued. So
much Murray had looked up before. Now, further
to satisfy himself, he went through all the directories
for the interval between the two years, and he was
rewarded by finding the name of Elmer Harkness
twice in one of them. Both were clerks, the addresses
of the employers not being given, and the residence of
one of them was put down as the address of the Harkness
who had secured insurance.
</p>
<p>
“Then there are, or at least there were, two,”
thought Murray, “but only one came from Madison.
And what has become of the missing Harkness? Why
is he in only one directory? The fact that there were
two helps to clear up the record of the one I insured,
so far as that Wabash Avenue address is concerned,
but how did both happen to give the same place and
date of birth? And did both have heart trouble?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
</p>
<p>
Murray straightened up suddenly and sent for the
clerk who had made the previous inquiries for him.
</p>
<p>
“Harry,” he said, “I want you to go to the funeral
of Elmer Harkness to-morrow. Go early, and get a
look at him, if possible. If not, get a description of
him from some of the neighbors.”
</p>
<p>
Murray reproached himself for not having searched
all the directories before, although it would have made
little difference. The fact that another Harkness had
lived in Chicago would have had no bearing on the
case, so long as the record of the one who applied for
insurance was clear. In fact, it would have explained
everything, except the coincidence of the alleged birth
records. Still, it would have given a new line of investigation,
which might have cleared up the mystery.
</p>
<p>
Harry reported promptly the next day, and almost
his first words aroused Murray.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t get a glimpse of the late lamented,”
he said flippantly, “for the casket was closed, but I
learned that he had hair slightly tinged with gray
and—”
</p>
<p>
“Gray!” exclaimed Murray. “Does a man get gray
hair in six months? The man we insured hadn’t a
gray hair in his head.”
</p>
<p>
“He was rather stout—”
</p>
<p>
“Our man was not.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t learn much else—”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve learned enough.”
</p>
<p>
“—except that when he was stricken his wife’s first
thought seemed to be to get a message to some mysterious man,
who responded in person, had a short
talk with the wife, and then disappeared. A neighbor
who had come in was somewhat impressed by this,
because she called him ‘Elmer,’ which was her husband’s
name.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Murray, startled out of his usual
imperturbability by the evidence thus unexpectedly
accumulating. Then, more calmly, “Harry, you
didn’t get the address to which she sent, did you?”
</p>
<p>
“The messenger,” said Harry, proud of his success,
“was a neighbor’s boy. I found him. Here is
the address.”
</p>
<p>
Murray took the slip of paper, looked at the address,
and then sent for the company’s physician.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll make identification sure,” he said, “for we
both know the man, and we’ll take an officer and a
warrant along with us.”
</p>
<p>
Elmer Harkness was sitting on his trunk, waiting
for an expressman, when the party appeared at the
door of his room in a little out-of-the-way boarding-house.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you were dead,” said Murray.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wish I was,” said Harkness. He had almost
fainted at the first sight of Murray, but had recovered
himself quickly, and, having once decided that
the case was hopeless, he resigned himself to the inevitable
and spoke with a frank carelessness that had
been entirely lacking when he was playing a part and
trying to stick to the details of a prepared story.
</p>
<p>
“Any weapons?” asked the policeman, making a
quick search.
</p>
<p>
“No weapons,” replied Harkness. “I’m not that
kind.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see,” said Murray, “why you waited here
to be arrested.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, I had a little interest in that insurance,”
explained Harkness, “and I rather wanted to get it
before leaving. However, waiting here was a little
trying to the nerves, even if everything did seem to
be going all right, and I was just about to slip up
to Milwaukee until the case was settled. I ought to
have gone the day Elmer was stricken.”
</p>
<p>
“What Elmer?” demanded Murray.
</p>
<p>
“Elmer Harkness, my cousin,” the other replied
promptly.
</p>
<p>
“And who are you?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m Elmer Harkness, his cousin,” he returned with
equal promptness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
“Which of you was born at Madison, Indiana?”
pursued Murray.
</p>
<p>
“He was,” replied Harkness, and added, “I was born
at Matteson, Illinois.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s a nice pair of names for a tangle,” commented
Murray as the possibilities of the situation
began to dawn on him. “No wonder my inquiries
failed to untangle it. Would you mind telling me how
you happened to try this thing?”
</p>
<p>
“No trouble at all,” returned Harkness. “It was
my cousin’s scheme. He had tried to get insurance
when he was living on Wabash Avenue and had failed.
He had a heart trouble that was likely to culminate
fatally almost any time. Still, I don’t think it occurred
to him to try to beat an insurance company
until we happened to be thrown together about a year
ago. We were cousins, although we never had met
before, and the similarity of names seemed to make
a great impression on him. He had just returned to
Chicago after a year or more in St. Louis, and he
already had had one heart attack, with a warning
from his doctor that the next would almost certainly
be fatal. He was also told that the next was not
likely to be long delayed. Now, I suppose you’ll
think I’m lying, but I did not take kindly to his
scheme, and the money alone would not have tempted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
me to go into it. I was sorry for his wife. He had
been able to make only a bare living; he could leave
her absolutely nothing. She never had had to support
herself and there seemed to be mighty little
chance that she could do it. I finally agreed to go
into it for her sake. It looked easy and I was glad to
make the try on her account.”
</p>
<p>
“But you wouldn’t refuse a little something for
yourself on the side, so to speak,” suggested Murray
sarcastically.
</p>
<p>
“No, I wouldn’t,” Harkness frankly admitted. “To
carry out the plan it would be necessary for me to
give up my job, change my name and make a fresh
start somewhere else. The job was not such an all-fired
good one, but it might be some time before I got
another as good, and I would need something for expenses
while I was losing myself. I was to get five
hundred of the three thousand dollars insurance. The
rest was to go to the widow.”
</p>
<p>
“That wouldn’t last her very long,” remarked Murray.
</p>
<p>
“It would help a little,” said Harkness, “and we
thought we would stand a better chance if we didn’t
ask for too big a sum.”
</p>
<p>
“An insurance company,” said Murray, “has to be
as particular with a small risk as with a large one,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
and it will follow up a suspicious case as closely in
one instance as in the other. It’s a matter of principle.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I understand that now,” remarked Harkness
regretfully.
</p>
<p>
“But I am curious to know,” persisted Murray,
“how in the world you arranged such a mystifying
record.”
</p>
<p>
“It was easy,” replied Harkness. “I gave you my
cousin’s place and date of birth, his parents, his marriage
and his life up to the time he left Madison. Then
I gave you my record up to the finish, with the exception
of one year, when he was in the Chicago
directory. We put that year in so you could get
trace of the wife in case you made any investigation.
I have no wife, and it was rather important, of
course, that there should be a record of a wife somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“It was a wise provision,” admitted Murray. “We
got trace of the wife at that flat.”
</p>
<p>
“It was after leaving there,” Harkness continued,
“that my cousin went to St. Louis. When he returned
we met and a little later fixed up the job.
As soon as I got the policy I rented the Sixty-fourth
Street flat, and my cousin and his wife moved in.
That’s all, I think, except that you ought to be a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
easy on me, I think, for giving you such an entertaining
story.”
</p>
<p>
Murray turned to the doctor with a pardonable air
of triumph.
</p>
<p>
“Was I right, Doctor,” he asked, “in saying that
it takes the novice to devise the really confusing
scheme?”
</p>
<p>
“You were right,” said the doctor.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span><a name='c12' id='c12'></a>AN INCIDENTAL GRIEVANCE</h2>
<p>
Jane Moffat, widow, was sore distressed.
</p>
<p>
“Without Tom,” she said, “I don’t know what I’ll
do. Tom was a good man, but unlucky. There was
better providers than Tom, but he was better than
none.”
</p>
<p>
This apparent reflection on her late husband did
not mean that Mrs. Moffat confined herself to the
financial point of view, for she had been a true and
devoted wife, but her present need was great and her
present resources were nothing. Furthermore, Tom
Moffat certainly had been either unlucky or incapable.
Mrs. Moffat, out of her affection for him, chose to
attribute their misfortunes to ill luck; another, less
considerate, might have said that Tom lacked ability
and stability; no one, however, could have said that
he was neglectful or indifferent—he did the best he
could, and his family always had all he could provide.
Nevertheless, Tom Moffat had drifted from one thing
to another, and his wife and two children had drifted
with him. He had worked at many things, and in
many places, and there had been times when he lacked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
work entirely. So he left Mrs. Moffat practically
nothing when he died.
</p>
<p>
“The neighbors was good,” continued Mrs. Moffat,
“an’ I’ve got some sewing to do. I was pretty good
at that in my younger days, but the children don’t
give me time to earn much, even if the pay was what
it should be. I had to sell some furniture already, an’
I don’t know what I’ll do. We’ve been going from
bad to worse.”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t he have no insurance?” asked the sympathetic
Mrs. Crimmins, whose husband was a member
of one of the fraternal organizations.
</p>
<p>
“Not when he died,” answered Mrs. Moffat. “Didn’t
I say he was unlucky? He had insurance when it
didn’t mean anything but paying out money, but
there ain’t any when the time comes for getting it
back.”
</p>
<p>
“They can’t take your money an’ not give you
nothing for it,” declared Mrs. Crimmins.
</p>
<p>
“Sure they can!” said Mrs. Moffat.
</p>
<p>
“I say they can’t,” insisted Mrs. Crimmins. “There
can’t nobody do that, if you got the sense to fight.
There was a lawyer once told my man so.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Tom paid the money, an’ it ain’t come back
to me, has it?” demanded Mrs. Moffat, as if that
settled the question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
</p>
<p>
“You ain’t tried to get it, that’s why!” retorted
Mrs. Crimmins. “You go see a lawyer. He’ll make
’em pay, an’ he won’t charge you a cent if he don’t
get the money. Some might, but I’ll tell you one
that won’t.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Moffat was not in a position to overlook even
a slight chance to get any money, especially if it cost
nothing to make the attempt. She knew less about
insurance than Mrs. Crimmins, and Mrs. Crimmins
had only wild, weird, second-hand notions. Still, Mrs.
Crimmins talked confidently, and Mrs. Moffat finally
took the address of the lawyer recommended to her.
This, of course, was a mistake—it would have been
better to go direct to the insurance company. But the
impression prevails in some quarters that insurance
companies are ready to take advantage of any technicality
to escape the payment of claims, and that a
lawyer’s services are necessary to compel them to pay
anything that can possibly be questioned. Some
lawyers, for their own purposes, encourage this idea.
Isaac Hinse, to whom Mrs. Moffat went, was one of
this class.
</p>
<p>
“You did well to come to me,” he said pompously,
as soon as she had stated her errand. “What chance
has a woman, with no knowledge of the law, against
a great corporation that has big lawyers engaged for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
the sole purpose of bulldozing or fooling the ignorant?
Fortunately, I know how to deal with them. Now,
where is this policy?”
</p>
<p>
“Tore up,” answered Mrs. Moffat.
</p>
<p>
“What!” cried Hinse.
</p>
<p>
“Tom tore it up when he couldn’t pay any more
on it. I ain’t looking for the whole thousand dollars,
but only to get back what he paid in. Mrs. Crimmins
said I could do that.”
</p>
<p>
Hinse leaned back in his chair and looked at the
ceiling thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he said at last, “that makes more trouble,
of course. An insurance company can’t escape its obligations
because the policy has been destroyed, but
it makes it more difficult to prove the claim. Do you
know what kind of policy it was?”
</p>
<p>
“How should I?” returned Mrs. Moffat. “I’m no
lawyer nor no insurance man. I come to you to learn
my rights.”
</p>
<p>
“Quite right, quite right,” conceded Hinse; “but
I must know something of the circumstances. When
was this policy taken out?”
</p>
<p>
“Fifteen or sixteen years ago,” answered Mrs.
Moffat. “We was doing pretty well then. Tom’s
aunt left him a bit of money, an’ Tom was workin’
steady an’ I got some money a little later. But Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
was always unlucky. He didn’t seem to hold on well,
an’ we kept movin’ an’ movin’ an’ gettin’ harder up—”
</p>
<p>
“And he finally let the policy lapse,” suggested
Hinse.
</p>
<p>
“Lapse!” exclaimed Mrs. Moffat, as if she had
made an important discovery unexpectedly. “That’s
it; that’s what he said when he tore it up an’ threw
it in the fire. I only knew he didn’t think it was
good, but Mrs. Crimmins says they got to pay back
what he paid them.”
</p>
<p>
“That depends on the policy and circumstances,”
said Hinse in his most impressive way—and Hinse
prided himself upon being impressive. “How long
did he pay premiums?”
</p>
<p>
“Eight or ten years.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” exclaimed Hinse. “There is a chance, but
it is a desperate chance—so desperate that I really
can’t afford to take this on my usual contingent fee.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s that?” asked Mrs. Moffat.
</p>
<p>
“I mean,” explained Hinse, “that I’ll get the money
for you if any one can, but I’ll have to charge five
dollars in advance.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Moffat hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“I got it,” she said, “but it’s rent money.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s more than rent in this,” declared Hinse,
“but why should I take all the risk? It is a hard case
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
and will take a great deal of my time, but I know
these people, and I think I can work it out of them.
You happened to come to just the right man.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Moffat was sitting on the opposite side of
the desk from Hinse, which she deemed fortunate at
this critical moment.
</p>
<p>
“There ain’t any safe place to leave money at
home,” she explained apologetically, “an’ a woman
don’t have safe pockets like a man.”
</p>
<p>
She made a dive down behind the desk, there was a
sound of moving skirts, and she straightened up with
three bills in her hand—a five and two ones. She
handed the five to Hinse, who promptly tucked it
away in his vest pocket.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what I’ll do about the rent,” she
sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Think of the insurance,” suggested Hinse, “and
remember that you’ve got the best man cheap. I’ll
see these insurance people to-day.”
</p>
<p>
Hinse was a large pompous man, who wore a long
rusty frock coat, because he thought that kind of coat
properly impressed his police-court clients. His
speeches also were for his clients, rather than for the
judge—he wanted to show them he was not afraid of
the court. He talked loud and aggressively. His
whole life being what is popularly termed a “bluff,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
it naturally followed that he considered bluffing the
main element of success.
</p>
<p>
That is where he made his mistake when he went to
see Dave Murray about Mrs. Moffat’s claim. Murray
was not in particularly good humor that day. A
friend had been arguing to him that corporations are
notoriously ungrateful for services rendered, and another
friend had endeavored to demonstrate that life
insurance companies had a way of forcing a man to
the limit of his endurance, of squeezing all the life
and energy out of him in a few years, and then dropping
him.
</p>
<p>
The worst of it was that some of the cases cited
Murray knew to be true: men were “forced” and then
left to seek other avenues of employment when insurance
had got the best that was in them. He had
argued that it was the universal business rule of “the
survival of the fittest”; that the man who had the
ability to get near the top need have no fear, and
that men who could stand the pace prospered wherever
they might be in the great system. But an unexpected
and rather harsh criticism from headquarters
had given him a more pessimistic view of the situation:
it could not be denied that comparatively few men
grew old in the service. Then there was a gloomy outlook
for a promotion he had expected, to add to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
annoyance, and—well, Murray, the energetic and
enthusiastic Murray, was momentarily dissatisfied.
He was in no humor to be “bluffed” by a pompous
shyster lawyer.
</p>
<p>
“I am representing Mrs. Jane Moffat,” announced
Hinse.
</p>
<p>
“What about her?” asked Murray shortly.
</p>
<p>
“She has a claim against your company.”
</p>
<p>
“Policy?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s see it.”
</p>
<p>
“There will be time enough for that,” said Hinse
in his most impressive tones, “when we have settled
what is to be paid on it.” Hinse was so constituted
morally that he could not possibly be frank and
straightforward. “It is a policy for a thousand dollars
on the life of her late husband, Thomas Moffat.
He failed to pay some of the last premiums, but there
is a value to it.”
</p>
<p>
“Is there?”
</p>
<p>
“There is. Will you look it up and see how the
matter stands, or shall I take legal proceedings to
force a settlement?”
</p>
<p>
“Better sue,” said Murray. “Good day.”
</p>
<p>
“You will regret this interview,” announced Hinse.
</p>
<p>
“I regret it already,” returned Murray. Then, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
professional instinct overcoming his dislike of the
man, he added: “If premiums have not been paid,
the policy may have lapsed, or it may be non-forfeitable.
I must see the policy and know the details. I
never heard of Thomas Moffat that I recall. Give me
the facts.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” said Hinse, settling himself comfortably in
a chair, “I thought you would see the wisdom of being
reasonable.”
</p>
<p>
“Reasonable!” exploded Murray. “Damn it! I’m
having trouble enough being patient. Who was he,
where did he live, and when did he die?”
</p>
<p>
There was something in the way this was said that
led Hinse to change his tactics, and he partly explained
the situation in a confidential way. Premiums
had been paid on the policy for at least eight years,
he said, but the widow had supposed that everything
was forfeited when her husband failed to pay the
later premiums: she knew nothing about cash surrender
values or non-forfeitable clauses.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll do what I say,” he said significantly in conclusion.
“She’ll compromise for any figure that I
say is right.”
</p>
<p>
He waited for Murray to reach for this bait, but
Murray was merely fighting an impulse to throw the
man out of the office.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she will!” said Murray at last. “Well, you’ll
talk more frankly than you have, if you want to do
business with me. Where’s the proof of death and
the proof of identity? Where’s the policy?”
</p>
<p>
Hinse ignored the last question. He wished to find
out certain things about that policy himself before he
admitted that it had been destroyed, and he thought
he was handling the matter with consummate skill.
</p>
<p>
“There will be no trouble about the proof of death,”
he said. “In fact, I have that with me. But Moffat
and his family moved many times during the years
that have elapsed since he stopped paying premiums,
living in two or three different cities, and they were
not always known to their neighbors.”
</p>
<p>
“I thought so,” remarked Murray sarcastically.
“Somebody died, and you want me to take it on faith
that he was the Thomas Moffat who once was insured
in this company. Although I haven’t looked it up,
I have no doubt that a Thomas Moffat did take out
a policy, for I don’t believe even you would have the
nerve to come to me without at least that much foundation
for your claim. Perhaps it was the same
Thomas Moffat who died; perhaps it was a man who
was merely given that name in the certificate of death.
Perhaps he left a widow; perhaps you are representing
that widow, but perhaps you are representing a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
woman who merely claims to be that widow. She has
moved so often that she can’t produce any satisfactory
evidence of her identity. Doesn’t it strike you that
you are telling a rather fishy story? Doesn’t it occur
to you that you ought to have ingenuity enough to
concoct something more plausible?”
</p>
<p>
“This insult, sir—” Hinse shifted again to his
pompous manner, but Murray interrupted him.
</p>
<p>
“Insult!” exclaimed Murray. “That wasn’t an
insult, but I’ll give you one. I think you’re a tricky
scoundrel. You have virtually offered to sell out your
alleged client. I think you’re a swindler. I don’t
believe you have or can produce any such policy.”
</p>
<p>
“The loss of a policy, sir—”
</p>
<p>
“I knew it!” broke in Murray. “Policy lost, of
course! In other words, your client hasn’t a policy
and never did have one. She’s an impostor! You or
she learned that there had been such a man and such
a policy, and you thought there was a chance to get
some money. You must think insurance companies
are easy.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall take this matter to court!” declared Hinse.
</p>
<p>
“Do!” advised Murray. “Take it anywhere, so
long as you take it out of this office.”
</p>
<p>
“You shall hear from me again!” said Hinse at the
door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’d rather hear from you than see you,” retorted
Murray. “You annoy me.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, when Hinse had departed, Murray
had the matter looked up, and found that such a
policy actually had been issued, that it was non-forfeitable
after three years, and that about four hundred
dollars was due on it as a result of the premiums that
had been paid. Murray was eminently a just man—he
wished to take unfair advantage of no one. There
might be merit in the claim advanced, and some woman,
entitled to the money, might be in great want. Still,
it was not his business to seek for ways of disbursing
the company’s funds. He reported the matter to the
home office, and was advised to give it no further attention
unless suit actually was brought. Then it
should be fought. Insurance companies do not like
lawsuits, but they like still less to pay out money
when there is doubt as to the justice of a claim. When
one of them goes into court, however, it fights bitterly.
Hinse knew this, and he had not the slightest intention
of bringing suit.
</p>
<p>
If Mrs. Moffat had had any more money, so that
there would have been a chance to exact further fees,
he might have sued for the mere sake of getting the
fees, but she could not even advance court costs. So
Murray waited in vain for the threatened suit, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
the possibility of it kept the case in his mind. The
claim probably was fraudulent, but, if not, the woman
unquestionably was poor and unfortunate: the very
fact that she had taken the case to such a shyster as
Hinse was proof of that. Somehow, the well-to-do
people do not get into the hands of shysters. Murray
believed it was a fraud, but he always came back
to the possibility of being mistaken in this. And injustice—the
injustice of passivity as well as of activity—was
abhorrent to him.
</p>
<p>
The day Murray ran across a newspaper item to
the effect that a Mrs. Thomas Moffat had been evicted
for the non-payment of rent, he disobeyed the instructions
from the home office and looked her up. In
theory it was all right to wait for a beneficiary to
bring in the necessary proofs; in practice it was horrible
to think of taking advantage of the ignorance
or helplessness of a woman in trouble.
</p>
<p>
Murray found Mrs. Moffat and her two children
in a little back room near the somewhat larger apartment
from which she had just been evicted. She
was trying to sew and care for the children at the
same time. It was evident, however, that she had long
since overtaxed her strength and was near the point
of physical collapse.
</p>
<p>
“The neighbors has been good to me,” she explained,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
“but they got their own troubles an’ they
can’t do much.”
</p>
<p>
Murray had primed himself with such facts as to
Thomas Moffat as the books of the company and the
old insurance application gave, and, after explaining
his errand, he asked when and where Thomas Moffat
was born. The weary woman, too long inured to disappointment
to be really hopeful now, brought out
a little old Bible and showed him the entries relating
to birth and marriage. They corresponded with the
dates he had. Murray took up the little Bible reverently,
and he then and there decided that this woman
was the widow of the Thomas Moffat who had been
insured in his company. Even her maiden name, as
given in the Bible, corresponded with the name he
had taken from the books. Nevertheless, he questioned
her closely on all the other details that he could verify.
She gave the address at which they were living when
the policy was taken out, and also told of the various
changes of residence during the time that the premiums
were being paid.
</p>
<p>
“He kep’ the big paper with the seals on it for
‘most three years after he quit paying,” she said.
“Then he tore it up an’ burned it. He said it wasn’t
no more use, for he’d lost it all when he quit paying.
It seemed mighty hard, but I thought he knew.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
</p>
<p>
“There isn’t even a scrap of it left?” queried Murray.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. He burned the scraps. I saw him do it.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s unfortunate,” said Murray. “If there was
barely enough to identify the policy it would help. It
would be annoying to have it turn up after we had
settled the matter, for the custom is to surrender the
policy to the company when the payment is made.”
</p>
<p>
“You needn’t to worry over that,” Mrs. Moffat
assured him anxiously. “It was burned to the very
last piece. I saw it myself.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t doubt it,” returned Murray. “Have you
your marriage certificate?”
</p>
<p>
“Have I!” exclaimed Mrs. Moffat in surprise. “You
didn’t never know an honest married woman who would
lose that, did you? A man don’t think much of it,
but a woman does. It’s the proof she’s respectable.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Moffat produced the certificate, but Murray
merely glanced at the names.
</p>
<p>
“I think you may rely on getting the money, Mrs.
Moffat,” he said. “It isn’t much, but—”
</p>
<p>
“I got a chance to start a little school store if I had
a bit of money,” she interrupted eagerly. “I don’t
need only two hundred or two hundred and fifty, an’
it’s better than sewing.”
</p>
<p>
“I am so confident that this is all right,” said Murray,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
ignoring the interruption, “that I am going to
advance you a little money now. I imagine you
need it.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed I do!” exclaimed the grateful and now
hopeful woman. “The lawyer got most of the rent
money.”
</p>
<p>
“Damn the lawyer!” ejaculated Murray. “If he
hears that you’ve got anything he’ll probably put in
another claim, but you’re not to pay him a cent. Do
you understand that? Send him to me. I’ll settle with
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” returned Mrs. Moffat meekly. “He
helped me—”
</p>
<p>
“Helped you! He did more to hurt you than any
other ten men could have done. He ought to be made
to pay damages.”
</p>
<p>
Then Murray laughed at his own heat and gave
Mrs. Moffat a twenty-dollar bill.
</p>
<p>
“When we get the matter settled,” he said, “you
can repay this.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed I will!”
</p>
<p>
Murray noted that there were tears in her eyes, and,
disliking a scene of any description, he picked up his
hat and hastily withdrew.
</p>
<p>
The matter, however, was not settled as easily as
he expected. He stated frankly what he had done,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
and the officials at headquarters seemed to think he
had taken unnecessary pains to make trouble. It was
not that they objected to paying any just claim
against the company, but they held that he had put
life into a slumbering claim that was at least open to
suspicion. Such evidence as she produced might have
fallen into the hands of an impostor, and there was
a considerable interval during which the connection
between the real beneficiary and the present claimant
was lost, the only explanation being that they had
made frequent changes of residence and had been
among strangers. In brief, the company did not consider
the claims satisfactorily established and criticized
the whole affair as being irregular.
</p>
<p>
Murray was disappointed and annoyed. He was
entirely satisfied in his own mind, and he resented the
criticism. Nevertheless, he sought for further evidence,
and Mrs. Moffat was finally able to supply it
in the shape of a receipt for the last premium paid.
This, it seemed, had not been destroyed with the policy.
Mrs. Moffat had discovered it among some old
papers. This Murray also reported.
</p>
<p>
“We are not satisfied with the evidence produced,”
was the reply that came back.
</p>
<p>
“I am satisfied,” was Murray’s answer, as he recalled
the woman’s tears of gratitude, “and I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
settled the claim and paid the money. Is my action
to be upheld or is my resignation desired?”
</p>
<p>
There was a long interval of silence on the part of
the officials at headquarters. This Murray understood
to be an evidence of their displeasure. Having thus
made their displeasure very apparent, the report was
finally returned with the single word, “Approved,”
written across it.
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless,” mused Murray, “I fear I am not
long for this business—at least with this company.
Either I am becoming both headstrong and sensitive
or else my superiors are becoming inconsiderate and
dissatisfied.”
</p>
<p>
That evening he took a long street-car ride, at the
end of which he entered a little store opposite one of
the big public schools. He wanted to see the result
of his work.
</p>
<p>
When he reappeared, a little woman followed him
to the door, and there was a quaver in her voice as
she said, “You’ve been so good to us, Mr. Murray, and
we’re so happy.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” returned Murray with a smile, “I’m happy
myself. And,” he added, as he was returning home,
“it’s worth all that it ever can cost me.”

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
